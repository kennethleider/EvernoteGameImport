         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>1998. HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named &quot;Best PC Game Ever&quot; by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide.<br/><br/>NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.<br/><br/>The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him.<br/><br/>The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source, Valve's new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:<br/><br/><ul><li><span class="copyHead">Characters:</span>Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial &quot;muscles,&quot; human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.</li><li><span class="copyHead">Physics:</span>From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.</li><li><span class="copyHead">Graphics:</span>Source's shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story and Monster's, Inc., creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.</li><li><span class="copyHead">AI:</span>Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.</li></ul></div>

An immense blast of anomalous energy transforms the Zone: the once reliable and relatively safe roads are no longer so, the landscape is wiped clean by outbursts of anomalies, and previously unknown areas appear on the Zone map. Stalkers and expeditions perish or end up isolated within the lost territories.<br/><br/>With the anomalous activity at its maximum, the unstable Zone continues to tremor with outbursts. The transformation of the Zone map destabilizes the fragile balance of forces in the Zone. Hostilities for the new territories, artifact fields and spheres of influence flare up among groups. There are no more old enemies or friends - now, everyone watches out only for themselves. The Factions War has begun.<br/><br/>The protagonist is a mercenary who appeared at the edge of the opposition between stalker factions, Strelok and even the Zone itself. The main character experiences the key role in the events that led to the creation of the Zone right up to the point from which the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game begins.<br/><br/>What new challenges await stalkers within the depths of the new zone? Why do anomalous outbursts continue to rattle the Zone, and what can be done to stop them? Which faction will take the upper hand in the Factions War? These and many other questions will be answered in the official prequel - S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky.</div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Braid is a puzzle-platformer, drawn in a painterly style, where you can manipulate the flow of time in strange and unusual ways. From a house in the city, journey to a series of worlds and solve puzzles to rescue an abducted princess. In each world, you have a different power to affect the way time behaves, and it is time's strangeness that creates the puzzles. The time behaviors include: the ability to rewind, objects that are immune to being rewound, time that is tied to space, parallel realities, time dilation, and perhaps more.<br/>Braid treats your time and attention as precious; there is no filler in this game. Every puzzle shows you something new and interesting about the game world.<br/>Key features:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Newly added Steam Cloud support</strong><br/>Save your in-progress game to the cloud, then play where you left off from on any Steam connected computer.<br/></li><li><strong>Forgiving yet challenging gameplay:</strong><br/>Braid is a 2-D platform game where you can never die and never lose. Despite this, Braid is challenging  but the challenge is about solving puzzles, rather than forcing you to replay tricky jumps.<br/></li><li><strong>Rich puzzle environment:</strong><br/>Travel through a series of worlds searching for puzzle pieces, then solving puzzles by manipulating time: rewinding, creating parallel universes, setting up pockets of dilated time. The gameplay feels fresh and new; the puzzles are meant to inspire new ways of thinking.<br/></li><li><strong>Aesthetic design:</strong><br/>A painterly art style and lush, organic soundtrack complement the unique gameplay.<br/></li><li><strong>Nonlinear story:</strong><br/>A nonlinear fiction links the various worlds and provides real-world metaphors for your time manipulations; in turn, your time manipulations are projections of the real-world themes into playful &quot;what-if&quot; universes where consequences can be explored.<br/></li><li><strong>Nonlinear gameplay:</strong><br/>The game doesn't force you to solve puzzles in order to proceed. If you can't figure something out, just play onward and return to that puzzle later.</li></ul></div>

Time has not been kind to Spencer: Five years after his heroic defeat of the Imperials, he has been betrayed by the government he swore to serve, imprisoned for crimes he didn't commit, and sentenced to death.<br/><br/>On the very day of Spencer's execution, terrorists detonate a massive experimental weapon in Ascension City, unleashing an intense earthquake that has turned the city into rubble and wiped out its population. With the terrain in ruins and the city's air defense grid now in the control of a massive terrorist force whose goal remains unclear, the FSA have only one option left - a behind-the-lines assault.<br/>It's the perfect job for a Bionic Commando.<br/>Bionic Commando transposes the much loved swing-and-shoot gameplay of the 8-bit original onto a stunning 3D environment of towering buildings, suspended roadways and monorails, deep canyons and sheer rock faces, which are traversed using swinging, scaling, climbing and wall-walking techniques.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Use the bionic arm to swing between towering skyscrapers at breathtaking speed, hook onto distant objects, zip up on hanging girders and choose your own route through the game<br/></li><li>Gameplay that moves through horizontal and vertical environments - a 3D game that truly uses all three dimensions.

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Who needs backstory? Who needs resource-gathering? Diplomacy is so last year. Gratuitous Space Battles cuts right to the chase of sci-fi strategy games, and deals with large, completely unjustified space battles between huge opposing space fleets.<br/>Gratuitous Space Battles combines the visual appeal of an RTS, with the addictive unit-placement and design gameplay from tower defense games. In GSB, the player does not control individual ships at all during battle. The ships fight to a pre-determined set of orders and formations given to them by you before the battles.<br/>GSB casts you as supreme space admiral, tasked with the design of individual spaceships, and the composition of your fleet, as well as general orders of engagement. This is not a twitch-based real time arcade game like many an RTS, but a game of careful thought, planning and big-picture strategy. Huge space battles can be won or lost depending on just how cleverly you balanced the needs of defensive shielding and armor against the expensive punch of laser cannons and plasma torpedoes.<br/>GSB also features an innovative multiplayer challenge system. You can upload your ultimate fleet to serve as the enemy to other players, and keep track of how many other players have won and lost against your challenge. That way, you will never run out of cunningly designed enemies to battle against!<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>4 different unlockable player races<br/></li><li>Over 40 different ship hulls<br/></li><li>Over 120 spaceship modules<br/></li><li>Choice of skirmish vs AI, never-ending survival mode or play against other players fleets with the online challenge system<br/></li><li>Play with different rules as each battle has different spatial anomalies to deal with.<br/></li></ul></div>

The game thrusts players into a world of freelance space hunters in the XXI-XXII century A.D. during a time of political crisis for the all-powerful Empire and the three mega-corporations that control all the known worlds. Corruption prospers planet-side and only space can give a man his freedom, but not without a cost: space is not a safe place anymore. Human space pirates, rogue AI computers that rebelled against humanity and empire patrol ships roam space in search of easy prey.<br/>Players begin the game as a bounty hunter with little more than an old, run-down space fighter and a dream, but as they advance in the game and prosper, their piloting and battle skills improve, allowing access to more advance spacecraft. Players can control a party of up to six bounty hunters, each possessing different skills, abilities and personality.<br/>Team tactics give players vast opportunities in battles when shear fire power isn't enough. Tactical ruses, planning and executing ambushes or deploying spaceships' special abilities provide cunning commanders the ability to crush enemies according to their style of play.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Spectacular 3D real-time battle system<br/></li><li>Original blend of tactical and action game play<br/></li><li>Variety of missions and mission-types including stealth, hit and run and assault missions<br/></li><li>Non-linear storyline and game play<br/></li><li>Secondary and secret quests along with primary missions<br/></li><li>Over 25 space fighters<br/></li><li>Dozens of energy and missile weapons<br/></li><li>Over 40 missions<br/></li><li>A choice of eight game characters, both male and female, to form your party<br/></li><li>Original RPG system<br/></li></ul></div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>While explosively stripping the evil pirate LeChuck of his demonic mojo, Guybrush Threepwood inadvertently infects the entire Caribbean with the arch-fiend's expelled voodoo, which threatens to transform buccaneers into unruly pirate monsters. Pursued by a notorious cut-throat Pirate Hunter and a creepy French Physician who believes that Guybrush's eerily-infected hand holds the secret of eternal life, Threepwood sails the seven seas in search of La Esponja Grande, a legendary sea sponge with unparalleled voodoo exfoliating abilities. But little does Guybrush know, his quest is part of a larger, more sinister plot, and good and evil are not always as they seem...<br/>Who can Guybrush trust? Where can he turn? Everything you think you know will be challenged as Tales of Monkey Island builds to its unexpected finale!<h2 class="bb_tag">About Chapter One</h2><br/><img src="http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/31170/extras/chp1icon.jpg"/>The saga begins with a heated battle involving the brave but often bumbling Mighty Pirate Guybrush, his beloved wife Elaine, and their nemesis, the demon pirate LeChuck. When the showdown goes up in flames, Guybrush finds himself marooned on a strange island with winds that always blow inward. How will our hero manage to escape this meteorological anomaly? What has become of LeChuck and Elaine? And what's the story with the infectious voodoo pox that's spreading across the Caribbean, causing Guybrush and other pirates to act like unruly hooligans? These are just some of the many questions posed in this first chapter of one of the most rollicking and rip-roaring entertainment experiences this summer.<h2 class="bb_tag">About Chapter Two</h2><br/><img src="http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/31170/extras/chp2icon.jpg"/>Guybrush's adventures continue on the high seas as pox-plagued pirates lay siege to the innocent Mer-People. In between defending the Mer-People and dodging the persistent pirate hunter hot on his trail, Guybrush manages to catch up to his beloved wife and despised arch-nemesis  but their reunion is short-lived. Now Guybrush must focus on eradicating the Pox of LeChuck before more harm can be done. And as the Mighty Pirate draws closer to a cure, the waters will only grow murkier in this thrilling chapter of the epic saga.<h2 class="bb_tag">About Chapter Three</h2><br/><img src="http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/31170/extras/chp3icon.jpg"/>In the third Tales of Monkey Island chapter, Guybrush gets in deep (literally!) as his quest for the voodoo exfoliating La Esponja Grande takes a scenic twist -- through the guts of a giant manatee!<br/>Trapped in the belly of the beast, our hero encounters a surprising band of castaways, including the long-lost (and obsessive-compulsive) explorer Coronado De Cava. Can the Mighty Pirate win the suspicious De Cava's trust? Will sexy pirate hunter Morgan LeFlay prove to be a ruthless enemy, or an unlikely ally? Will the group find La Esponja Grande in time to save Elaine from the rampant Pox of LeChuck? And will the world be crushed by the gnashing teeth of a certain demonic skull? Tales of Monkey Island's moist and absorbing third episode, Lair of the Leviathan, will answer some of these urgent questions -- and raise still more -- as the five month adventure builds to its epic climax!<h2 class="bb_tag">About Chapter Four</h2><br/><img src="http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/31170/extras/chp4icon.jpg"/>Guybrush returns to Flotsam Island, but forget about a hero's welcome. Handed over to De Singe by the backstabbing Morgan LeFlay, Guybrush is seized by an angry mob and put on trial! With a silk-tongued prosecutor in his face and a hangman's noose dangling over his neck, Guybrush must figure out how to defend himself against grave accusations. Meanwhile, the determined Marquis sets his sights on a new and far more attractive test subject. How on earth will the Mighty Pirate get out of this mess?

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Tidalis is a block-based puzzle game with casual appeal, hardcore depth, and an addictive new &quot;streams&quot; mechanic. The game is brimming over with riffs and variants on that core mechanic with 20 game modes, dozens of special blocks and items, and 115 levels in the adventure mode alone. The basic rules of the game are this: blocks fall down into the board and have a color and an arrow direction. If a stack of blocks exceeds the height of the board, you lose. In order to clear blocks, you must right-click and drag paths through the arrows to set up chain reactions of like-colored blocks.<br/>If this sounds simple, that's because it is -- you'll be lining up lengthy chains within minutes. But you'll be surprised how much brainpower it takes to set up combos of multiple chains, and the many brainteaser-style puzzles include some real stumpers. Tidalis has co-op and competitive multiplayer modes (both online and offline); action-oriented modes and timer-less brainteasers; a lengthy, casual-friendly adventure mode; twenty unique game modes providing innumerable twists to the basic gameplay; dozens of special blocks and items; and over fifty minutes of beautiful music to go with the painterly art.<br/>In short, several games' worth of content are built on top of this core mechanic, which you'll quickly find to be as iconic as it is novel.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Puzzle game with casual appeal, hardcore depth, and an addictive new mechanic.<br/></li><li>Two-player co-op and competitive play (both local and networked).<br/></li><li>A wide selection of both action-oriented or brainteaser-like levels.<br/></li><li>Casual-friendly adventure mode, hardcore-focused custom games and vs modes.<br/></li><li>20+ game styles, and dozens of items and special blocks.<br/></li><li>Rich, painterly art style and beautiful music.<br/></li><li>Players can create and share whole new themes, levels, and adventures.<br/></li><li>Options for colorblind players, players averse to lots of light and motion, and older computers.<br/></li></ul></div>

The world has become consumed by the ever rising tide of the global population flood. Fertile land has been reclaimed by rising oceans and expanding deserts, resulting in famine and poverty on an unprecedented scale. Water is now mankind's most precious resource, and conflict erupts wherever it flows.<br/>Only one bubble of the old capitalist world survives. The Queen of the World is the largest ship ever to grace the oceans, a colossal city at sea where the wealthy elite live in exile from the chaos which surrounds them. Onboard this stateless paradise the Five Founding Fathers set about pursuing their Cornucopian research unimpeded.<br/>The contempt of the outside world is offset by NanoCell Corporation, one of the five, who promise to develop nano-technology to purify sea water at the molecular level and make the deserts bloom with the food of the world. But as they move closer to their goal, the bitterness of fanatical Malthusians grows.<br/>The so called 'Neo Malthusians' timed their attack perfectly. 9.8 billion watched as they recast hope as hatred, following a prophecy to commit global genocide; drowning the planet with blood as they slash the worlds population to a mere half billion 'righteous souls'. A prophecy they will soon find themselves in a position to fulfill.</div>

The AI subcommanders will fight you to the death when they see you -- but your glimmer of opportunity comes from quietly subduing those subcommanders without alerting central processing to the danger until it's too late.<br/><br/>You do have a few things going in your favor. Your ships are much faster. You have safe AI routines to automate defenses and mining outposts. You have production techniques that can churn out fully-outfitted unmanned fighters in seconds. There will never be more than a few thousand of your ships versus tens of thousands of theirs, but through careful strategy you must somehow reach and destroy the heavily-guarded AI cores.<br/><br/>Go forth into the galaxy, steal AI technology, recapture those planets you must in order to achieve your ends, and save what remains of humanity.

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Half a century after the Red Faction resistance and their Marauder allies freed Mars from the brutal Earth Defense Force, harmony on Mars is again threatened but this time by a lethal force shrouded in mystery.<br/>When the massive Terraformer that supplies Mars with its Earth-like air and weather is destroyed, the atmosphere turns to chaos, super-tornados and lightning storms engulf the planet.  To survive, the Colonists flee to the underground mines and build a network of habitable caves.<br/>Five years later,<strong>Darius Mason</strong>, grandson of Martian Revolution heroes<strong>Alec Mason</strong>and<strong>Samanya</strong>, runs a lucrative business from Bastion, underground hub of Colonist activity.  Mining, scavenging, mercenary work--if the job is dangerous, Darius is your man.  Few sane people now venture to the ravaged surface, aside from contractors like Darius and the smugglers who run goods between the settlements.<br/>When Darius is tricked into reopening a mysterious shaft in an old Marauder temple, he releases a long-dormant evil and unleashes Armageddon on Mars.  As Colonist and Marauder settlements are torn asunder, only Darius and the Red Faction can save mankind.  The battle will take them across the storm-blasted planet--and below it, to the very heart of the unspeakable threat.<br/>Red Faction: Armageddon expands on the critically acclaimed, best-selling franchise with new, groundbreaking challenges.

Two rival branches of the Royal House of Plantagenet - the house of Lancaster (the reds) and the house of York (the whites)  fight over the throne, and the player is thrown into the fray.<br/><br/>The years of 1455-1485 in England are an extraordinary setting filled with conflict, treachery and bloodshed. In the wake of the death of chivalry at Agincourt in 1415 and the introduction of gunpowder, warfare changed - the gloves came off, so to speak. The old and the new clashed on the battlefield while personal vendettas motivated the desire for war.<br/><br/>War of The Roses sees players go toe-to-toe with their opponents using authentic and visceral weapons of the time period including broad swords, long bows and battle-axes.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features:</h2><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Four Ways To Play</strong> Play as a Footman, Gaurdsman, Longbowman, or Footknight allowing you to explore the various combat options that fight your expertise best.<br/></li><li><strong>Mass Devastation</strong>- Up to 64 player competition in both Team Death Match and Conquest modes.

A mysterious paramilitary force infiltrates a multi-billion dollar aerospace compound, taking hostages but issuing no demands. The government responds by sending in a Special Forces team only to have them obliterated. Live footage of the massacre shows an inexplicable wave of destruction tearing the soldiers apart. With no other recourse, the elite F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) team is assembled to deal with the extraordinary circumstances. They are given one simple mission: Evaluate the threat and eliminate the intruders at any cost.<br/><strong>F.E.A.R. Extraction Point</strong>Extraction Point kicks off where the original game ended  with a bang. As the helicopter which the F.E.A.R. team is on attempts to leave the vicinity, it instead winds up crashing. The F.E.A.R. team is thus forced to seek out an alternate extraction point, all the way battling the now free Alma and her paranormal minions across a destroyed city.<br/><strong>F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate</strong>As the first F.E.A.R. team and Delta Force fight for control of the situation, a second F.E.A.R. team is sent in to shed some light on Armacham Technology Corporation's (ATC) dark past.

Snowblind Studios is in the unique position of drawing inspiration from both the literary and film rights to world of Middle-earth, allowing players to bloody their axes on a wide range of deadly enemies and traverse both established and never-before-seen locations. The result is a journey that is both epic and intimate, familiar yet unexpected.<h2>Key Features:</h2><ul><li><strong>Action Meets RPG</strong>- Intense, visceral, and satisfying combat. Rich, layered, and impactful character progression. In War in the North, you get both. Find and equip the best loot, upgrade your hero using a wide range of skills and items, and feel the intense satisfaction of rushing into real-time battles with friends by your side. Fight through the brutal realities of the war on all fronts that were brought to life in the lore. Immerse yourself and make your own mark on Middle-earth.</li><li><strong>Co-op at its Core</strong>- Build your own fellowship of three heroes to confront the growing army in the North. The survival of your group and all of Middle-earth depends upon your uniquely skilled heroes working together. You must fight together or you will die alone, and these high stakes make the experience of playing together both socially engaging and incredibly satisfying. The first time you rescue a friend who has been grabbed by a troll and is desperately yelling for help, you will understand what we mean.</li><li><strong>An Untold Story</strong>- While much attention and focus has been placed on the journey of the One Ring, the assault on Middle-earth hits all corners of the map. War in the North turns our attention towards an integral part of the storyline that is grounded in details within the books and various appendices. This is not someone elses fight. This is your own effort to forage a way through the dark, dangerous, and unknown landscape, defending all that is yours. This is your war.</li></ul></div>

Dynamically combine local (splitscreen) and online players and leave/join any time, so that the games always full.<br/></li><li><strong>Tower-Defense Meets Action-RPG</strong>- Choose your class, customize your character &amp; equipment, strategically assemble your defenses, and participate directly in action-packed battle to preserve your castle against the invading horde!<br/></li><li><strong>4 Distinct Character Classes</strong>- Each character class has a different skill tree, set of towers, and even basic attacks! You can choose if you want to play stealthy, turn invisible, and plant traps behind enemy lines with the Huntress or go all out, block off choke points, and brutally beat your foes into submission with the Squire!<br/></li><li><strong>Loot and Level-Up</strong>- Grab the mounds of money and items that your defeated foes drop and trade them or store them for later use in your Item Box! Getting kills and completing waves earns you experience points, which can be used to upgrade your characters, skills, equipment, and towers on a per-statistic basis.

Others have YOU attacking enemy encampments!<br/></li><li><strong>Collect and Trade Pets Online</strong>- A variety of pets exist to assist you in the land of Etheria, each with distinct behaviors. These pets can be leveled-up and customized to match your unique play-style. They can even be traded online with other players!<br/></li><li><strong>Secure Trading System</strong>- Afraid another player won't live up to their word? Use our secure trading system to trade your precious weapons, armor, and pets with other players online! Watch your name and fame spread online, as people seek out the best pet raisers or item forgers!<br/></li><li><strong>A Mountain of Stats</strong>- Every shot you take, kill you make, and defense you build is logged and recorded for posterity.

Furthermore, your Achievements are visible for all to see within your very own Adventurers Tavern, and the highest scores for each of your heroes are ranked on the worldwide leaderboards!<br/></li><li><strong>Dungeon Defenders Development Kit</strong>- Dungeon Defenders includes a free development kit where you can create and edit new Dungeon Defenders missions and more utilizing all of the existing Dungeon Defenders assets.

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2><strong>Brink</strong>is an immersive first-person shooter that blends single-player, co-op, and multiplayer gameplay into one seamless experience, allowing you to develop your character whether playing alone, with your friends, or against others online. You decide the combat role you want to assume in the world of<strong>Brink</strong>as you fight to save yourself and mankinds last refuge.<strong>Brink</strong>offers a compelling mix of dynamic battlefields, extensive customization options, and an innovative control system that will keep you coming back for more.<br/><br/><strong>Brink</strong>takes place on the Ark, a man-made floating city that is on the brink of all-out civil war. Originally built as an experimental, self-sufficient and 100% green habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earths oceans has forced the Ark to become home to not only the original founders and their descendants but also to thousands of refugees. With tensions between the two groups growing, Security and Resistance forces are locked in a heated battle for control of the Ark. Which side will you choose?<br/><br/><h2 class="bb_tag">KEY FEATURES:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Not Just Another Hero</strong> Brink's advanced player customization offers a near-endless combination of looks for your character  allowing for the appearance of your character to be truly unique.  As you progress through the game and acquire more experience, youll have even more opportunities for customization.<br/></li><li><strong>Two Sides to Every Story</strong> Choose to fight through the single player campaign as either a member of the Resistance or the Security and then take your same character online to play cooperatively or competitively against other players.<br/></li><li><strong>Blurring the Lines</strong> Take your unique character online at any time you choose!<strong>Brink</strong>allows you to seamlessly move between your single player campaign, co-op with friends, and intense multiplayer action. Multiplayer takes the story online where you can play with up to seven other people (or AI characters) cooperatively as you take on the opposing faction or with up to 16 players competitively.<br/></li><li><strong>Play SMART</strong> Brink uses the familiar shooter controls that youre used to, without frustrating, artificial constraints and adds a new feature: the SMART button.  When you press the SMART button, the game dynamically evaluates where youre trying to get to, and makes it happen. Whether youre a seasoned FPS veteran or someone just getting started, youll be able to make more intelligent decisions during the fast-paced action with SMART.<br/></li><li><strong>Context-Sensitive Goals and Rewards</strong>- Objectives, communications, missions, and inventory selection are all dynamically generated based on your role, your condition, your location, your squad-mates, and the overall status of the battle in all gameplay modes.  Youll always know exactly where to go, what to do when you get there, and what your reward will be for success.<br/></li></ul></div>

Dear Esther immerses you in a stunningly realised world, a remote and desolate island somewhere in the outer Hebrides. As you step forwards, a voice begins to read fragments of a letter: &quot;Dear Esther...&quot; - and so begins a journey through one of the most original first-person games of recent years. Abandoning traditional gameplay for a pure story-driven experience, Dear Esther fuses its beautiful environments with a breathtaking soundtrack to tell a powerful story of love, loss, guilt and redemption.</p><p>Forget the normal rules of play; if nothing seems real here, its because it may just be all a delusion. What is the significance of the aerial -- What happened on the motorway -- is the island real or imagined -- who is Esther and why has she chosen to summon you here? The answers are out there, on the lost beach, the windswept cliffs and buried in the darkness of the tunnels beneath the island Or then again, they may just not be, after all</p><p>Dear Esther is supported by Indie Fund.</p><h2>Key features:</h2><ul><li>Every play-through a unique experience, with randomly generated audio, visuals and events.</li><li>Explore Incredible environments that push the Source engine to new levels of beauty.</li><li>A poetic, semi-randomised story like you've never experienced in a game before.</li><li>Stunning soundtrack featuring world-class musicians.</li><li>An uncompromisingly inventive game delivered to the highest AAA standards.</li></ul><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>Jessica Curry's haunting and beautiful soundtrack to Dear Esther, now available on Steam, has been a hit with gamers and critics alike.

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>A 2D sidescroller without a linear path. An action game with tactical combat and citybuilding. An adventure game that lets you free-roam a vast, procedurally-generated world. A Valley Without Wind defies genre stereotypes. Unlike other procedurally-generated games, you also get a logical progression in difficulty, plus helpful tips and checklists to guide your travels (should you need them).<br/>Choose for yourself how to prepare to face the vastly stronger Overlord. Complete a variety of missions to earn new spells, and/or roam the wilds to uncover secret missions and stashes of magical crafting loot. Customize your characters with unique combinations of enchants and spells that change how you move, jump, and fight. Or rescue people and bring them back to your settlement so that they can then be sent on dispatch missions; you don't have to carry the burden of your fledgling civilization alone!<br/>You choose how to play, and the world adapts around you.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Travel alone or with friends across an ever-expanding world of dangerous creatures, powerful magic, high technology, and mysteries.<br/></li><li>You have choice. The world of Environ is a procedurally generated sandbox, and lets you go anywhere you see -- including right into the overlord's keep at any time. (Good luck with that.)<br/></li><li>Environ is endless. When you save one continent from an overlord, a larger and more complex continent appears.<br/></li><li>The game adapts to how you play: as you demonstrate your proficiency, monsters and missions upgrade accordingly. Killed 100 bats? Okay, time for... bats on fire!<br/></li><li>Crazy amounts of character customization. Combine a multitude of spells, enchants, and equipment to create specialized character builds.<br/></li><li>Play as a long line of brave adventurers. It's not a question of IF your character is going to die, but WHEN. Any character that dies is permanently lost, but you keep all your inventory, enchants, and general progress in the game.<br/></li><li>Become a community leader. Rescue NPCs for your settlement, construct buildings for them, and improve their skill and mood -- then send them on dispatch missions to help you in return!<br/></li><li>Be a clever problem-solver. Challenges have more than one solution, each with its own pros and cons. You get to figure things out rather than just jumping through a set of hoops.<br/></li><li>Difficulty levels give exactly the challenge you want, from casual to hardcore on platforming, combat, and citybuilding independently.<br/></li><li>All owners of Valley 1 also get the much-improved sequel absolutely free!  Valley 2 is out now, and features a different style of more-focused, non-sandbox play.  Both games are quite distinct from one another, but you dont have to choose between them -- both are yours for the price of one!<br/></li></ul></div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>A modern take on the 16-bit era, A Valley Without Wind 2 blends a variety of mechanics across multiple genres, seamlessly bringing together the best qualities of old-school platform-shooters and turn-based strategy games.  You choose how and where to explore via the world map, how to upgrade your character via mage classes, feats, and perks that you unlock, and how to battle the forces of evil every step of the way.<br/><br/>Your character is a mage who has infiltrated the inner circle of the evil Demonaica, and you now share the power of immortality that he uses to terrorize the land. Using this power against him, it's time to lead an uprising and ultimately bring him and his henchmen back to mortality so that they can be dispatched.<br/><br/>Gameplay alternates between two modes that complement each other: brief, tightly-designed platforming segments where your character customization and equipment can be tuned to meet the tactical needs of the current stage; and quick strategic turns on the world map where you order your troops to fight, scavenge, build, recruit, farm, and use special powers.  Demonaica and his armies pursue your forces directly on the world map, while his five henchmen have been sent to recapture you in the platforming segments.<br/><br/>Your immortality came at great personal cost, but it makes you the one last hope of saving the world from darkness.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Platforming and Turn-Based Strategy Coupled Together:<br/><br/>Flip back and forth between your own adventure, and the progress of the resistance you're in charge of.  Freely adjust difficulty levels for both to tailor the experience to your own personal playstyle.  Both sides of the game can be quite easy or incredibly hard.<br/></li><li>More Tactile Combat:<br/><br/>The physics of movement and attacks have been completely redone from the first title, with more traditional gamepad and keyboard support. Spells have mass and can block each other, leading to many interesting tactical situations in the platforming segments.<br/></li><li>Vastly Improved Visuals:<br/><br/>Fully redone artwork by Heavy Cat Studios, including 125 all-new monsters, 200 spells, and lots more.<br/></li><li>Focused Gameplay Arc:<br/><br/>Unlike the endless sandbox-style first game, this complete re-imagining has a distinct beginning, middle, and end.<br/></li><li>Procedurally Generated Worlds:<br/><br/>Each world is a unique challenge, leading to excellent replay value once you do beat the game!<br/></li><li>Co-Op Multiplayer:<br/><br/>Bring along as many friends as you like on your journey, depending on your connection speed. 2-8 players recommended on most Internet connections; many more on LAN.<br/></li><li>See Just How Deep An Arcen-style Rabbit-Hole Goes:<br/><br/>After dozens of hours you still haven't seen it all: 50 mage classes in 5 tiers, 200 spells, 125 enemies, 14 biomes, 100+ types of world map tiles, 64 character customization perks, 100ks of procedural equipment possibilities.<br/></li><li>Extra Challenges For Expert Players:<br/><br/>String together flawless kills to earn &quot;concentration&quot; and become even stronger.  Beat the game on harder difficulties to earn rare achievements.<br/></li><li>Get The Original Game For Free!<br/><br/>The original game was unique and experimental, and it comes included absolutely free when you buy the sequel.</li></ul></div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Legend of Grimrock is a dungeon crawling role playing game with an oldschool heart but a modern execution. A group of prisoners are sentenced to certain death by exiling them to the secluded Mount Grimrock for vile crimes they may or may not have committed. Unbeknownst to their captors, the mountain is riddled with ancient tunnels, dungeons and tombs built by crumbled civilizations long perished now. If they ever wish to see daylight again and reclaim their freedom the ragtag group of prisoners must form a team and descend through the mountain, level by level.<br/><br/>The game brings back the oldschool challenge with highly tactical real-time combat and grid-based movement, devious hidden switches and secrets as well as deadly traps and horrible monsters. Legend of Grimrock puts an emphasis on puzzles and exploration and the wits and perception of the player are more important tools than even the sharpest of swords could be. And if you are a hardened dungeon crawling veteran and you crave an extra challenge, you can arm yourself with a stack of grid paper and turn on the Oldschool Mode which disables the luxury of the automap! Are you ready to venture forth and unravel the mysteries of Mount Grimrock?<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Explore a vast network of ancient tunnels, discover secrets and find a way to survive in the perilous dungeons of Mount Grimrock.<br/></li><li>Cast spells with runes, craft potions with herbs and fight murderous monsters with a wide variety of weaponry.<br/></li><li>Create a party of four characters and customize them with different races, classes, skills and traits.<br/></li><li>Pure blooded dungeon crawling game with grid-based movement and thousands of squares riddled with hidden switches, pressure plates, sliding walls, floating crystals, forgotten altars, trapdoors and more.<br/></li><li>Includes the following digital extras: a beautifully crafted game manual, Legend of Grimrock world map, custom made grid paper, Grimrock theme music, art sheets illustrating foul creatures of Grimrock, and Almost Human team photo.</li></ul></div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Gratuitous Tank Battles (GTB) is a unique hybrid of tower-defense, strategy, simulation and RTS. Set in an alternate history timeline where World War I never ends, you are the commander of allied forces fighting right up to the year 2114, where Mechs and lasers are used alongside tanks and rifles. The war continues across Europe, with the allied commanders still locked into the optimistic patriotism of the 1900s.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A tower-defense game where you can play as the attacker has been done before, but GTB lets you play the same maps as attacker OR defender, and even lets you save out your attack as a recording to defend against. An online-challenge system lets you upload your custom maps and custom units and attacks for other players to fight against. Speaking of custom units, GTB doesn't have simple pre-built units, but allows you to build them from individual components, and even design the appearance and colors of every single unit. An unlocks system gradually reveals more modules, abilities and unit 'hulls' to experiment with.<br/><br/><br/><br/>GTB also features an integrated map editor that lets you trivially change and tweak existing maps, or create entirely new ones, and the process of sharing these custom maps with friends is built right into the game. Combine it with Steam achievements, community, cloud support and more, and you should be kept busy fighting over Europe for another two hundred years./&gt;<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Alternate History Tower Defense: Fight a 200 year war to save Europe<br/></li><li>Play as attacker or defender on any map, even custom ones<br/></li><li>Fight with Infantry, Tanks, Turrets and Mechs<br/></li><li>Optional Adaptive AI adjusts to your play style and tactics for endless variety<br/></li><li>Customizable units allow you to design your own personal army<br/></li><li>Built-in level editor makes creating a new map a breeze<br/></li><li>Save out your attack and play against it as the defender<br/></li><li>Online map and challenge-sharing system allows you to fight your friends armies</li></ul></div>

Sent back to the past, player will discover the story when Knight Artorias still lives.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>New Bosses  Including Black Dragon, Sanctuary Guardian, Artorias of the Abyss.<br/></li><li>PVP Arena &amp; Online Matchmaking System  Quick matching for players to play 1vs1, 2vs2 and 4 player battle royal.<br/></li><li>New Areas  Including Oolacile Township, Oolacile Sanctuary, Royal Wood, Battle of Stoicism which is the training ground for online PVP battles.<br/></li><li>New Enemies  Including Wooden scarecrows, Chained Prisoner, Stone Knight.<br/></li><li>New NPCs  Including Hawkeye Gough, Elizabeth (keeper of the sanctuary).<br/></li><li>New Weapons and Armor  Equip some from the new bosses, enemies, and NPCs</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">The Story</h2>Dark Souls is the new action role-playing game from the developers who brought you Demons Souls, FromSoftware. Dark Souls will have many familiar features: A dark fantasy universe, tense dungeon crawling, fearsome enemy encounters and unique online interactions. Dark Souls is a spiritual successor to Demons, not a sequel. Prepare for a new, despair-inducing world, with a vast, fully-explorable horizon and vertically-oriented landforms. Prepare for a new, mysterious story, centered around the the world of Lodran, but most of all, prepare to die. You will face countless murderous traps, countless darkly grotesque mobs and several gargantuan, supremely powerful demons and dragons bosses. You must learn from death to persist through this unforgiving world. And you arent alone. Dark Souls allows the spirits of other players to show up in your world, so you can learn from their deaths and they can learn from yours. You can also summon players into your world to co-op adventure, or invade other's worlds to PVP battle. New to Dark Souls are Bonfires, which serve as check points as you fight your way through this epic adventure. While rested at Bonfires, your health and magic replenish but at a cost, all mobs respawn. Beware: There is no place in Dark Souls that is truly safe. With days of game play and an even more punishing difficulty level, Dark Souls will be the most deeply challenging game you play this year. Can you live through a million deaths and earn your legacy?<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Extremely Deep, Dark &amp; Difficult  Unforgiving in its punishment, yet rewarding for the determined  learn to strategize freely and conquer seemingly impossible challenges.<br/></li><li>Fully Seamless World  Explore a completely integrated world of dark fantasy where dungeons and areas are seamlessly intertwined, with great height.<br/></li><li>Mastery Earns Progression  Contains 60 hours of gameplay, with nearly 100 uniquely despair-inducing monsters &amp; an incredibly nuanced RPG systems including: weaponry, armor, miracles, faith, and more. Player success depends on their eventual mastery of how and when to use the magic spells, choice of armor, the number of weapons, the types of weapons, and the moves attached to the weapons.<br/></li><li>Network Play  Players may cross paths with one another, invading each other for PVP battles, or to play co-op and take on giant boss encounters as a team.<br/></li><li>Flexible Character Development &amp; Role Play  As the player progresses, they must carefully choose which of their characters abilities to enhance as this will determine their progression style.<br/></li><li>Community  See other real players and empathize with their journey, learn from seeing how others died, find and leave messages for your fellow players; helping them or leading them into death.<br/></li><li>Symbolic of Life &amp; Hope  The Bonfire is an important feature in Dark Souls for many reasons. Though in gameplay it serves as a health and magic recovery and a progression check point, it also happens to be the one place in the dark world where players can find a fleeting moment of warmth and calm.</li></ul></div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Long ago, the Dark Lord Dredmor was bound in the darkest dungeons beneath the earth by great and mighty heroes. Centuries later, the magical bonds that hold him in place are loosening and his power grows ever stronger. The land cries out for a new hero, a powerful warrior or a mystic wizard like those spoken of in the prophecies of yore.<br/>What they have, unfortunately, is you...<br/>Step into the Dungeons of Dredmor! Embrace your destiny! Face evil of the likes the world has never known - the terrifying Swarmies, the undulating Thrusties, and the adoreable nest-building Diggles. Worship Inconsequentia, the Goddess of Pointless Sidequests, or try your luck as a devotee of the nameless Lutefisk God. Cast powerful magic learned from the dark business warlocks of the school of Necronomiconomics, or summon the Viking Runes of your ancestors to blast your foes with thunder and lightning! Discover the power that can be had by wielding a bizarre armament of devastating weaponry such as the Interdimensional Axe, the Plastic Ring, and the Invisible Shield (if you can remember where you left it). Wield shoes decorated by the Dwarven Glittersmiths, all of whom have now committed suicide because of their shame, and embrace the joys of destroying giant moustache-wielding brick demons with a mace decorated with tawdry, delicious bacon.<br/>While youre at it, be prepared to die. A lot. In hideous, screaming pain that makes you throw your keyboard out the window.<br/>The Dungeons of Dredmor await. Are you ready for them?<br/><br/><h2 class="bb_tag">Key features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Classic Roguelike gameplay with the sweet, refreshing taste of point-and-click interfaces. No longer must you press CTRL-ALT-SHIFT-x to drink a potion.<br/></li><li>Randomly generated dungeons entice you with the sweet, sweet promises of treasure and  things.<br/></li><li>Old-school pixel goodness. Face lovingly hand-animated monsters and enjoy the great taste of beautiful, individually rendered items on top of a sea of gorgeous, potent tile-work.<br/></li><li>Wield the awesome power of the Anvil of Krong, lest it wield you!<br/></li><li>Incredibly complicated crafting system! Wield relics of the Great Elven/Dwarven conflict; grind down ingots to make powdered aluminum and shove it directly up your nostrils!<br/></li><li>Hordes of monsters never-before-seen in a video game!<br/></li><li>Deploy cunning traps to defeat your foes!<br/></li><li>Infinite replay value: choose from a selection of mind-boggling skills to create your character.

He is part of the lowest social class, doomed to live his life in literal mountains of trash. He hopes for an opportunity to get into the world of the rich, who live in a floating city high above the clouds. Fate seems to smile on the snotty good-for-nothing when one day the attractive lady named Goal from the higher sector plummets into one of the trash heaps. Rufus decides to help the young woman out by taking her back to her husband. When he notices that Goal's husband is a dead ringer for himself, he hatches a diabolical scheme to gain access to the upper world. However, things don't work out quite as planned, since he has feelings for the beauty which limits his usual unscrupulousness.<br/><br/>Help Rufus, the poor boy from the junkyard, to win over the girl from heaven.

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Thomas Was Alone, and then, Well, he Wasn't.<br/><br/>Thomas Was Alone is an indie minimalist 2D platformer about friendship and jumping and floating and anti-gravity. Guide a group of rectangles through a series of obstacles, using their different skills together to get to the end of each environment.<br/>Listen to awesome music by David Housden. Jump over rectangles meticulously placed by Mike Bithell. Listen to voiceover read wistfully and a bit amusingly by Danny Wallace.<br/><br/><br/>Thomas Was Alone tells the story of the world's first sentient AIs, and how they worked together to, well, not escape: Escape is a strong word. 'Emerge' might be better. 'Emerge' has an air of importance about it, while keeping the myriad plot twists and superhero origin stories you'll discover under wraps. We didn't even mention the bouncing. That'd be overkill.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Beat 100 levels, and uncover the story of the AIs.<br/></li><li>Utilize the unique skills of 10+ characters.<br/></li><li>Immerse yourself in David Housden's critically acclaimed procedural score.<br/></li><li>Chuckle along to Danny Wallace's narration.</li></ul></div>

Step into the role of the Gunzerker, whose highly deadly skills allow him to dual-wield any two weapons found in the game. Not only that, you will build on that skill to do more things with two guns than you ever imagined possible. Dual machine guns? Cool. Dual rocket launchers? Of course! Dual Sniper Rifles? Sure, if thats your thing! Want to try other styles? More tactical perhaps? There are multiple classes to choose from!<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Dynamic Co-op online, and LAN:</strong>Share your adventures with friends both online and via LAN.

From the arctic tundra, through the dangerous grasslands, past the mysterious corrosive caverns to beyond, youll be surprised by the unpredictable world of Pandora at every turn!<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Brand new enemies:</strong>A whole slew of new enemies are out there to kill you in Borderlands 2.

In a time of uncertainty, when the city is besieged by plague and ruled by a corrupt government armed with industrial technologies, dark forces conspire to bestow upon you abilities beyond those of any common man  but at what cost?

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Xenonauts is a strategy game in which you control a multi-national military organisation defending a Cold War-era Earth from alien invasion, using small squads of persistent soldiers to eliminate the extraterrestrials and recover their technology in turn-based ground combat. A detailed strategic layer allows you to co-ordinate the defence of the planet, using your interceptors to shoot down UFOs and researching captured artefacts to learn about your foes and unlock new combat equipment to use on your missions.<br/><br/>Xenonauts is a spiritual successor to the classic X-Com strategy games from the 1990s. We aim to improve the graphics, add new content and streamline the interface whilst still retaining all of the key mechanics of the original games. Devoted fans should love this game, but we're also keen to introduce the joys of old-school grand strategy to a whole new generation of players who might not otherwise experience it!<br/><br/>Please note that the native Mac / Linux versions of the game are still in beta, however older WINE-wrapped &quot;ports&quot; are available and known to be stable whilst development of the native ports is still ongoing.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Ground Combat: Xenonauts delivers tense turn-based combat across realistic, varied and fully-destructible battlefields, against almost fifty different variants of enemy. Missions range from capturing crashed UFOs or alien bases to defending cities (or even Xenonaut facilities) against alien attack. You'll experience the chill of encountering a new alien for the first time and the joys of test-firing a new weapon for the first time. Deeply asymmetric combat keeps the battles interesting - after all, you're fighting intergalactic invaders with 1970's ballistic technology!</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Strategic Management: You will also be managing the defence of the planet, dealing with the invading alien UFOs with your customisable interceptors. You need to balance the needs of your funding nations with your own. Your funds are limited - are you going to spend them on battlefield equipment, more scientists, or expanding your coverage of the planet? Your priorities must be balanced carefully if you are to win the war.</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Research Tree: Xenonauts has an extensive research tree with almost a hundred projects to unlock, each with its own unique description and painted artwork. It slowly reveals the intentions and origins of the invaders, while also unlocking new battlefield equipment, aircraft and vehicles for you to use as you harness alien technology and turn it against them.</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Persistent Soldiers: Soldiers in Xenonauts are persistent from mission to mission, improving their stats and gaining ranks with combat experience - but their deaths are always only a single bad move away. You will grow to care about the brave men and women under your command as they slowly grow from green rookies into hardened veterans, but that only makes it more painful when their heroic tale is cruelly cut short by a burst of plasma fire...</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Detailed, Emergent Simulation: Xenonauts contains no scripted missions, just broad rules setting the pace of the invasion. As such, no game plays out the same twice. If you shoot a Scout UFO down over a polar area, you get a Crash Site mission where you can capture a crashed Scout UFO in an Arctic tileset. Commence a battle at night and you'll be fighting the mission in the darkness with reduced sight range. If your base is attacked, you fight the defence in a perfect replica of your base. A lot of time has gone into weaving the two very different halves of the game together into something that feels both natural and enjoyable.</li></ul></div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Conquest of Elysium 3 (CoE3) is a streamlined turn based fantasy strategy game with a touch of rogue-like and the complex undertones of Illwinter's Dominions series. While CoE3 appears to be a simple game with limited options at first glance, delving further into the game reveals a game of complex decision making and risky endeavors.<br/><br/>The main focus in CoE3 is that each race plays differently. We're not talking about a unique building and unique unit, we're talking about completely differently, with different mechanics and different goals.  Perhaps you're playing a druid, focused on amassing a vast forest and jungle empire from which to harvest ingredients to summon creatures of the woods with no practical need to conquer mines. Perhaps you're a dwarf, who's only concern are mines and produce units at a set rate every turn, focused almost entirely on upgrading those units to survive as long as possible since they are so difficult to replace. With 18 different factions that alone is enough to keep your play dynamic as you vie for control of the map to conquer Elysium. That isn't where it ends, however, there are 6 scenarios in which your game takes place that will help randomize the map. These scenarios range from a the early days of an agrarian world to a giant gleaming capital, which you can conquer, that spawns patrols of human guards, to a fallen empire filled with the living dead and scarred by battlefields and tombs. There's also random events to contend with, from merchants to pillage to the very gates of the underworld opening portals to your realm, your hands will be full before you even make contact with the enemy.<br/><br/>In each game the objective is to defeat your enemies by relying on the strengths of your chosen race. Combat in CoE3 is automatic to keep things streamlined, but that doesn't make it non-strategic. Each unit has a desired &quot;location&quot; it wants to be in the battlefield. Archers want to be in the rear, heavy infantry want to be in front. As you can imagine, putting together an army that has enough strength to protect the powerful archers and spell casters in the rear is vital. It goes beyond that though, as you must determine your enemy's strengths and hopefully be able to counter their strategy. An army of a mere 10 trolls is extremely dangerous, perhaps able to bring down a dragon, but they can only kill 10 creatures at once. An army of 50 small units will make short work of your trolls. However, an army with a wizard able to cast high level spell may completely destroy all 50 small units in one shot but would be unable to harm 10 trolls. Determining the strength and composition of an enemy army is a vital skill, and since hitting in combat, damage, and even the very spells that will be cast are randomized based on the abilities of each unit, every battle invites potential disaster and a change of plans.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>18 different classes that are unique, both in resources they need and the rituals or special abilities they have<br/></li><li>Copious amounts of monsters and random events, good and bad<br/></li><li>Random maps.<br/></li><li>Spell system with 42 magic paths<br/></li><li>Network or hotseat multiplayer<br/></li><li>Team play, you can be 2 players against the AI for example.<br/></li><li>Stealth and invisibility. Scouts needed to detect stealthy troops, something better (a star spawn or a beast bat will work) needed to detect the invisible ones.<br/></li><li>Assassins that make an assassination attack before combat starts.<br/></li><li>Catapults, Hill Giants and Rocs that can throw or drop boulders during sieges.<br/></li><li>Immortal Liches and Vampires.<br/></li><li>Regenerating trolls rise from the dead if they haven't been killed too badly or their side lost.<br/></li><li>Large worms that can swallow smaller enemies whole. Swallowed units take a few points of damage from digestion each round until they are freed.<br/></li><li>Shape changers that looks like something else when seen by the enemies.<br/></li><li>And many many more monsters and abilites....</li></ul></div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Defender's Quest is a Tower-Defense/RPG Hybrid (Think Final Fantasy Tactics meets Tower Defense). It focuses on three things: tactical depth, customization, and story.  That means no random encounters, no spikey-haired emo kids, no forced time sinks, and no tedious, repetitive battles.<br/><br/>The battle system builds off of tower defense, with individual characters taking the place of towers.  Each character levels-up, learns skills, and equips gear individually, allowing the player to customize their battle experience and strategy.  The overall game structure is similar to &quot;tactical&quot; RPG's, but with a real-time battle system.  Game speed is adjustable, and commands can even be issued while the game is paused.<br/><br/>It also features an engaging, character-driven story written by an actual English major! The story strives to be fast-paced, snappy, and always relevant to gameplay with minimal exposition. Finally, it's got options and accessibility settings out the wazoo, so that you can have the best possible experience!<br/><br/>--------<br/><strong>NOTE:</strong>this game is currently locked at 30 FPS. This is mitigated by three factors:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>You have full control of time, so it doesn't affect reactions.<br/></li><li>The sprite sheets wouldn't animate any faster at 60 FPS anyway<br/></li><li>A full HD/60 FPS upgrade is coming soon as a<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.fortressofdoors.com/dq2-update-and-announcing-dq1hd/" target="_blank">free upgrade</a>.</li></ul><br/>---------<br/><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.defendersquest.com/1/?page=eula" target="_blank">End User License Agreement</a></div>

With six distinct classes to explore, each combat role, vehicle and weapon has extensive skill trees that will allow players to grow characters laterally, unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, equipment, specialized skills, vehicles, and more. Play as one of six distinct classes:<br/><br/>-<strong>Heavy Assault</strong> Rush into the battle ahead, guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis.<br/>-<strong>Light Assault</strong> Go where the Heavies cant with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade and surprise your foes!<br/>-<strong>Combat Medic</strong> Keep your fellow soldiers healed- its your job to revive fallen comrades.<br/>-<strong>Infiltrator</strong> Stealthy and silent, you are death from the shadows.  Whether you choose a knife from behind or a single shot from snipers nest, you are the enemys greatest fear.<br/>-<strong>Engineer</strong> A crucial support class with the ability to repair important gear including vehicles, terminals, and turrets.  Engineers can drop their own shielded turret and mow down advancing troops.<br/>-<strong>MAX</strong> Heavily armored, cannons for hands, and a disposition to match, you are the ruler of the battlefield and a walking mass of armored death.</li></ul><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>OUTFIT TEAMWORK:</strong>Outfits play a very important role in each and every battle. From a small group of specialized soldiers or rapid response team, to a huge clan that can field multiple platoons of hundreds of players, outfits have access to unique customizations allowing them to create their own identity and manage their reputation and overall role in the ongoing war.<br/></li><li><strong>VEHICLES &amp; WEAPONS:</strong>Players are able to access a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized for player preference or purposed with unique attachments and add-ons earned in game to fit each players style.<br/></li><li><strong>PLAY FOR FREE:</strong><strong><i>PlanetSide 2</i></strong>is Free-To-Play with an additional in-game RMT marketplace with items that range from cosmetic camouflage patterns and armor paint jobs, to XP accelerators.

Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the Rings and Spinal Tap, its a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving humanity and Heavy metal tunes. Featuring the talents of comedian, actor and musician, Jack Black as super roadie Eddie Riggs, as well as cameos by some of the biggest names in metal music it's a wild ride in the belly of the beast that is not to be missed by gamers and Metalheads alike.</p><p>Included as a free bonus in the PC version of Brtal Legend are both the Hammer of Infinite Fate and Tears of the Hextadon multiplayer map packs.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>The vivid and wildly creative world of Brtal Legend is brought to life through a spate of chrome, leather, rocker babes, epic music, fire-breathing/stud-wearing beasts, mountains made of guitar amps, and more. Follow Eddie as he embarks on a tour of epic destruction with an axe, a guitar, and his minions as he commands the power of rock in epic band battles. Its lighter-flicking awesomeness that will melt your face clean off.</p><p><strong>Combat</strong></p><p>Brtal Legends combat is a combination of classic action slasher and real time strategy mechanics.  Melee and ranged combat come from your double-sided broadaxe and demon-slaying, pyrotechnic-creating guitar.  Add that 1-2 punch to a guitar solo mechanic that can summon objects, buff your teammates, or cripple your opponents, and you have a deep, gratifying core gameplay combat loop that is fun for the hardcore and accessible for the casual.  On top of that, players will journey from Roadie to Rock God by commanding legions of metalheads into Brtal Victory and sending troops charging into battle.</p><p><strong>A Streaming Open World</strong></p><p>Brtal Legend gives you the freedom to walk, drive, or fly anywhere in a fully streaming open world whose art style is inspired by some of the most iconic and hilariously rad metal album covers ever created. Every vista in the beautiful universe of Brtal Legend looks like it was pulled from a Frank Frazetta painting.</p><p><strong>Packed With Cameos and Voice Talent</strong></p><p>Brtal Legend is full of cameos from gods of metal like Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, and many, many others. It has a MASSIVE metal soundtrack from every era of metal music: 1970s classic metal to 1980s hair metal to the scarier cousins of 1990s metal. And of course, Jack Black pays the ultimate homage to metal as Eddie the Roadie, continuing the theme from the work of his band, Tenacious D and his previous films like School of Rock and High Fidelity.</p><p><strong>Multiplayer Mayhem</strong></p><p>4v4 &quot;skirmish&quot; multiplayer marries action combat with a strategic unit-control mechanic. As the leader of one of the factions in the game, the player will direct his armies in a Battle of the Bands where the trophy is survival. Brtal Legends multiplayer is online-enabled, so you can conquer your friends online (broadband connection required for online play).</p><p><strong>Music</strong></p><p>The music in Brtal Legend is truly massive. Made up of 108 of the most rocking tracks from 75 different bands representing every sub-genre of metal, it is something to experience in and of itself.</p></div>

These aren't your typical Zed -- theirs is a very different sort of apocalypse. Animals spontaneously transform into twisted, violent beings.  The earth decays, collapsing into a network of abysses.  The wilderness thickens.<br/><br/>It has been nine years since That Day when it all started.  Pockets of humanity still exist, but are ignorant of one another.  Within these isolated havens people try to live as best they can -- for even in a world so broken and dark, daily life must go on.<br/><br/>Darrell and Mary Williams were able to build such a life inside a five-acre fenced yard out in the country.  They were even secure enough in their isolated compound that they had a daughter five years after the zombie-like grays appeared.<br/><br/>Life carried on as normally as it could, until another refugee on the run is killed during a nearby attack. Her son is saved and taken in by the Williamses -- who do not realize that this kind action will destroy their home and threaten their entire family.  They find themselves caught in the midst of a struggle between two eldritch horrors, and the path to survival is anything but clear.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Solve environmental puzzles under pressure.

      <long-description>
         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Space Rangers HD: A War Apart remasters and expands the world of the cult classic Space Rangers 2. The game is developed by the SNK-Games team in close cooperation with fans of the series.<br/><br/><br/>The biggest of the improved features is a new scenario dedicated to the pirates threatening the galaxy. While the Coalition spends all of its resources to fight the Dominators (sentient machines who seek to eradicate all life), the pirates have united under the banner of a mysterious leader. Under this new master they have begun their own guerrilla war to seize power in the weakened Galaxy. Players can now choose with whom to deal, the Dominators or the pirates, or both at the same time. If you choose the latter path, you will receive new story and side quests, new goals and promotions. After winning one of the wars, you can either finish the game or continue playing to win another.<br/><br/><br/>Players begin their pirate career as the lowest of the low, and will make their way to the top of the pirate hierarchy, completing story missions and learning new information about the organization and its unknown leader whose actions threaten the very existence of the Coalition of sentient species. All player actions affect what kind of place the Galaxy will be at the end, with the victorious Coalition that managed to overcome its enemies or with a collapsed alliance from both external Dominator and internal pirate pressures.<br/>The game has received a major technical overhaul in addition to the addition of new content. All of the main menu, loading screens, planet and space station vistas were reworked. Now you can choose a display resolution of up to 19201200 and planetary battles employ modern render technologies.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>New pirate subplot. After completing any one of the story branches a player can either end the game, or continue playing to complete another branch. the players actions influence the entire Galaxy, while the balance in either of wars may be tipped not only by the player, but by AI actions as well. No two playthroughs will be the same.<br/></li><li>Major technical overhaul. Display resolutions up to 19201200, multi-core processors, Windows 7, and anti-aliasing in 3D planetary battles are now fully supported.<br/></li><li>Extended soundtrack means youll hear more than 15 completely new musical themes specially created for deeper immersion into the amazing Space Rangers universe.<br/></li><li>Other improvements include more than 10 new text adventures, 15+ planetary battle maps, 20+ government missions, unique non-story events, new equipment and micromodules, access to all hyperspace engagements from the main menu and more!</li></ul></div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>MAN MEETS MAGIC &amp; MACHINE. The year is 2054. Magic has returned to the world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Technology merges with flesh and consciousness. Elves, trolls, orks and dwarves walk among us, while ruthless corporations bleed the world dry. You are a shadowrunner - a mercenary living on the fringes of society, in the shadows of massive corporate arcologies, surviving day-by-day on skill and instinct alone. When the powerful or the desperate need a job done, you get it done... by any means necessary.<br/><br/>In the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the citys most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed.<br/><br/>The unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation nearly 25 years ago. Now, creator Jordan Weisman returns to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical RPG.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Gripping Tactical Combat: When youre running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With the variety of weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. A successful run requires commanding a team of runners with the right balance of combat, tech, and magical abilities.<br/></li><li>Skill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun Returns classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose. Want to start summoning spirits as an ork Shaman and evolve into a cybered-up weapon specialist? Do it!<br/></li><li>Engaging 2D/3D Art Style: Shadowrun Returns mixes dynamic 3D characters and lighting with a vibrant, hand-painted environment. Illustrated character portraits bring every conversation to life. Explore a world filled with detail, from the slums of the Redmond Barrens to the extravagant offices of powerful corporations.<br/></li></ul></div>

All your training has brought you to this point - you are here for one reason only: to be the best.<br/><br/><br/>Strike Suit Infinity is a frantic high score chaser where your skill is the only thing that matters. Whatever combat experience you have had so far is considered irrelevant. There is no end to the enemies you will face. There is no winning.

Upgrade your Strike Suit and customize your weapon load-outs to tailor combat to your tastes. Take advantage of three very different Strike Suits to experience dogfighting action as youve never seen it before.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Fast, frantic space combat: freely engage multiple enemies, dogfight other pilots and fight massive fleet battles.<br/></li><li>The Strike Suit: strategically switch from Pursuit Mode (speed and power) to Strike Mode (a powerful, highly maneuverable combat mode).<br/></li><li>Its all about your score  build your multiplier, take down waves of enemy as fast as you can, and race to the top of the leaderboard.<br/></li><li>Manage your strategy  use credits in between rounds to purchase upgrades and reinforcements for the next round.<br/></li><li>Capital Ship Destruction: take capital ships apart piece by piece  take out their turrets and target weak-points to blow out entire sections of their superstructure.<br/></li><li>Ship Designs from renowned Mechanical Design engineer Junji Okubo (Appleseed: Ex Machina, Steel Battalion).<br/></li><li>Music from award-winning sound designer Paul Ruskay (Homeworld) including a collaboration with Japanese singer/songwriter Kokia (Tales of Innocence, Gunslinger Girl: II Teatrino) and Subsource.<br/></li><li>Joystick compatible: as well as being fully optimized for mouse and keyboard, and gamepads, Strike Suit Infinity is compatible with a range of joysticks for full immersion.<br/></li><li>Vicious new enemy types</li></ul>*DOES NOT REQUIRE STRIKE SUIT ZERO TO PLAY*</div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Ghat's story is far from over: Zeno Clash 2 picks up where the deliciously brazen first game left off.  After 4 years of waiting, the sequel to the surreal first-person brawler brings more variety in combat and levels, and even more bizarre storytelling into the beguiling world of Zenozoik.  Join forces with your former foe Rimat and battle against scores of angry denizens, preventing their dastardly machinations from being realized.<br/><br/>Zeno Clash 2 welcomes new players to the Zeno Clash universe with a new game that will bring them into the universe and fill them in on the backstory. Returning players will delight in the connections between the new settings and the first adventure. All players will thoroughly enjoy playing a first-person brawler that provides a rarity in modern gaming: a truly unique experience.<br/><br/>Zeno Clash 2 has beefed up its combat engine with precision punch targeting, blocking, and high-impact hits that only make the bone-crunching, face-rattling fistcuffs more satisfying. The new &quot;Lock-on&quot; function gives players a wider range of control for dishing out the damage. New RPG mechanics will allow Ghat and Rimat to punch harder, defend better, and recruit more powerful allies to aid in their quest. Zeno Clash 2 now harnesses the full power of the Unreal III engine to bring the bizarre and beautiful world of Zenozoik to life. ACE Team's boundless imagination brings gamers into a universe of surreal foes, fantastic locations, and truly unique visuals that is unlike anything else you will ever play. With the newly added drop-in/drop-out co-op play, Zeno Clash 2 invites you AND a friend to dive once more into the fray!</div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>How do you balance -- and indeed encourage -- a war between factions without letting either side obliterate the other?  How do you rule over gods, creatures, and men who refuse to obey you?  How do you build a landscape of villages when bandits and mythology are conspiring to tear it down?  Skyward Collapse places you into the role of The Creator, and frees you to tackle these problems your own way.  Brought to you by the developer of the modern strategy classic AI War: Fleet Command, Arcen's second full strategy title is equally unique (but far easier to learn): a turn-based 4x strategic god-game.<br/><br/>Your task is to build and populate the floating continent of Luminith.  You create -- but cannot control -- gods, creatures, and artifacts from both Greek and Norse mythology.  The power you wield with these is immense: Heimdall's horn causes everyone outdoors to drop dead, for crying out loud.  Your task is to keep both factions alive and fighting until The Master calls you home -- but this is harder than it sounds.  Bandit Keeps pop up periodically, as do Woes such as floods, serial killers, guild strikes, and vegetarian uprisings.  Every game plays out differently, and you'll need even the craziest of your powers in order to survive what lies in store for you.<h2 class="bb_tag">Game Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>A turn-based strategic god-game where you control neither faction, but instead strive to maintain the balance of power.<br/></li><li>Make towns and war as the boardgame-like floating continent continues to construct itself around you.<br/></li><li>Persuade your minions into doing what you want by controlling the circumstances of their (brief) lives.<br/></li><li>16 gods, each with unique passive abilities and three active powers, help you further your goals as you pass into the Age of Monsters.<br/></li><li>Level up your player profile by winning games. Twelve unlockable buildings in all!<br/></li><li>Straightforward controls paired with an intuitive and helpful interface make this an easy title to pick up... but the strategy runs deep.<br/></li><li>Multiple difficulty levels let you play a very relaxed game up to a nail-bitingly difficult one.  There's no one best way to win!<br/></li><li>Co-op multiplayer for up to 8 players.</li></ul></div>

You can define your own islands, each one created in moments by our rather clever British Countryside Generator. These islands are then populated by a raving aristocracy of murderous robots, their robot hounds, and worse. You job is simply to survive, and get home.<br/><br/>You're not entirely alone, though: The disembodied voice of Walters, your butler, will help you and offer advice.<h2 class="bb_tag">Ultimate AI Threat</h2><br/>Sir's AI is one of the toughest in stealth, and as an open-world game, it's unique in its field. The robots are some of the most aggressive and intelligent game enemies you will ever experience, and will pursue you even after losing sight of you. Expect to be hunted!<h2 class="bb_tag">The Most British Of Games</h2><br/>Sir, You Are Being Hunted is set in a parallel Britain, complete with bleak villages, rocky highlands, bramble-filled woodland, decrepit farms, and crumbling post-industrial landscapes. Made with the remarkable power of our British Landscape Generator, these landscapes are enormously evocative and teeming with detail. Take time to explore, and find that vital hidden flask of tea!</div>

Surrounded on all sides, you must outmaneuver and outsmart the enemy.<br/><br/>The enemy is closing in around you.  Your soldiers are being flanked and the perimeter is slowly collapsing under a vicious alien assault.  Robotic turrets will not last much longer.  Just a little more and the bugs will swarm into your unprotected base.  What are your orders?<br/><br/>You order your soldiers to fall back to a defensive chokepoint and rebuild your defenses.  Sacrifice the forward squads to gain some extra time.  Gather your team while equipping them with flamethrowers and laser guns.  Start building a siege cannon for fire support.  Then, while the aliens are busy, flank their main hives to destroy and capture them.<br/><br/>You have just pulled off a tactical victory - but there's no time to rest.<br/><br/>The aliens are constantly mutating.  One moment your shotguns are ripping through the horde, the next the aliens grow hard, bullet-proof armour.  You must adapt as well.  Equip your team with stealth suits, miniguns, grenade launchers - your commands will decide the battle's outcome.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Real time tactical combat<br/></li><li>A lengthy campaign where you develop new weapons<br/></li><li>Procedural maps and random mutation system keep the game fresh<br/></li><li>21 Human weapons and buildings for you to wield<br/></li><li>33 Alien mutations to keep you on your toes<br/></li><li>Fight thousands of enemies at once</li></ul></div>

Cook, Serve, Delicious: Battle Kitchen Edition is a brand new free expansion that provides all new local multiplayer modes and weekly challenges! From 25 indie guest cameos to tons of new features and improvements, CSD: Battle Kitchen will challenge even the most hardened cook. Some of the new features include:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Weekly Challenges</strong>- Face off with your friends and the Steam leaderboard as you compete for the fastest times. A new challenge awaits every week!<br/></li><li><strong>Tag Team Local Multiplayer</strong>- Grab some controllers and play up to four players locally as you take turns manning the chef station in Battle Kitchen. You only have fifteen seconds to cook, and five seconds to explain to the next cook what to do first! Good luck!<br/></li><li><strong>Strike Challenges</strong>- Take on twelve brand new challenges on your own or up to four players tag team with adjustable difficulty settings. Warning: these challenges can be extremely difficult!<br/></li><li><strong>Endurance Mode</strong>- For one player or up to four Tag Team players, Endurance Mode has you making as many foods as possible perfectly, all while having to answer Chef Risotto's calls and switching out menu items and upgrading them while you're cooking. How long can you last? Also includes the new eSports Endurance Challenge, an event that ups the difficulty to an extreme degree!<br/></li><li><strong>Co-op Campaign</strong>- Play the campaign mode with a friend using your current save! One person is the expediter, who must give orders to the chef and send them out when they're fully cooked, and the other is the chef, unable to choose orders but must cook or do anything the expediter gives them. Tag each other to switch positions on the fly, and make your way from a zero star cafe to a five star restaurant! (co-op can be enabled or disabled at any time in the main menu of the campaign mode).<br/></li><li><strong>Game Improvements</strong>- A huge array of game improvements and additions have been added to the game! For more, visit the official announcement page here:<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/games/247020/announcements/detail/204114190854399404" target="_blank">http://steamcommunity.com/games/247020/announcements/detail/204114190854399404</a></li></ul>---<br/><br/>Cook, Serve, Delicious is a hardcore restaurant sim, one of the few in its genre that gives the players total control over where they want to take their restaurant.<br/><br/>The game centers on an old, worn down restaurant in the SherriSoda Tower, which was once the heart of the building but closed down as business (and tenants) dropped to an all time low. But with the local economy rising back up and occupancy reaching its maximum, SherriSoda Tower has decided to bring back the old Cook, Serve, Delicious restaurant, and has given you complete control to bring it back to its old five star status of world class dining.<br/><br/>To do that, youll start with a few thousand dollars and thirty foods to choose from to put on your menu, as well as a host of restaurant equipment and more. Nearly everything is unlocked from the start of the game for you to purchase; this is your restaurant, and you must figure out the best strategy to get that restaurant packed with satisfied customers. Can you prove your culinary skills?<br/><br/>And if that werent enough, youll also have the opportunity to be cast in the Iron Cook television show, throw parties for offices in SherriSoda Tower, read virtual mail in your SherriSoda Tower Email account which ranges from game tips to crazy spam (nearly 500 emails in all), from customers providing feedback to your restaurant to opportunities such as being able to fund projects via ClicknStart and other big surprises!<br/><br/>With hours of content and tons of secrets and unlockables, Cook, Serve, Delicious will provide a big challenge for anyone whos ready to take their crumbling, rat infested eatery to a luxurious Platinum Star Restaurant. Good luck!<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>New Steam Features include key binding support for all foods and events, a new gameplay option called CookBets where you will receive randomized challenges each day, fifty new spam emails and options as well as improvements to UI across the board, and full Steam Achievements, Steam Cloud, Steam Leaderboards with special Steam Challenges and Trading Cards support.<br/></li><li>Includes the upgrade pack, &quot;Extra Crispy Edition,&quot; that brings ten new foods to the game including Lobster, Bananas Foster, Enchiladas, Sushi and more!<br/></li><li>Steam Controller, DualShock 4, Xbox 360, Wii U Pro Controller, DualShock 3 and Xbox One gamepad button mapping fully supported for compatible controllers. Rumble is also supported (for Windows only). (Note: first and third party drivers still required for full compatibility.<strong>For a full detailed list, be sure to check out the Steam thread:</strong><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/247020/discussions/0/598199244891051604/" target="_blank">http://steamcommunity.com/app/247020/discussions/0/598199244891051604/</a>)<br/></li><li>Music by award winning composer Jonathan Geer<br/></li><li>Art by Sara Gross - Two Bit Art (Battle Kitchen art by Camille Kuo)</li></ul></div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>At the dawn of time, a terrible war raged between the forces of good and evil, ending in the destruction of the world of Agarest. After their victory, the Gods of Light unified the decaying bodies of the Gods of Darkness and created a new world.<br/><br/>Now, the forces of darkness are awakening once again<br/><br/> Choose the path of Darkness or Light through a truly epic story, spanning multiple generations<br/> Battle hundreds of different creatures using an array of character abilities, in a compelling and innovative turn-based combat system<br/> Build your ultimate army of warriors and master Extra Skills, Special Arts and Over Kills to defeat colossal enemies!<br/> Unite with your chosen heroine and use the Soul Breed system to shape the fate of the next generation of heroes<h2 class="bb_tag">Agarest: Generations of War - Exclusive game features!</h2>Agarest: Generations of War includes many unique features that cannot be found in any other Strategy Role Playing Game. Here's a summary of some of the best:<br/><br/><strong>Extended Area</strong><br/><br/>Extended Area is the &quot;Linked Area&quot; set for both your party and your enemies. Each character in the game has a uniquely shaped extended area. When a character's turn comes around, all other characters in the Extended Area of the character in play (and characters in the extended areas of those characters!) can combine in an extended attack. This allows you to chain your party's attacks together, allowing access to more Arts and huge Combos!<br/><br/><strong>Blacksmith's Guild</strong><br/>You can upgrade various Items and Equipment at the Blacksmith's Guild in two different ways:<br/><br/>By Enhancement: You can enhance equipment to a maximum of Level 5. Once an Item is enhanced to Level 5, you can convert the Item, changing it into something else. This process is irreversible and the original item is lost. Experimentation reveals some great new items!<br/><br/>Through Alchemy: Alchemy allows you to combine several items to create a single, more powerful piece of equipment. While you lose the items used in the alchemy, you gain a powerful new piece of equipment and permanent access to your new item in the Shop! Alchemy can create powerful new weapons and armour but occasionally a Smithing Accident will occur and the smith will create a different item than what you expected!<br/><br/><strong>The &quot;Soul Breed&quot; system</strong><br/>Agarest takes place across 5 generations of heroes, starting with your first character, Leonhardt. During each generation you will build relationships with 3 different female party members, and at the end of each generation's story arc you must choose to marry one of the girls.<br/><br/>Your choice of marriage partner is restricted to girls who've grown fond of you over a particular generation. Your options are determined by your choices during conversations at certain points of the story.<br/><br/>The girl you choose as your wife - and the strength of their relationship with you - will determine the abilities of the main character in the next generation of the story. You'll have to experience multiple play throughs to see all of the character possibilities open to you! What heroes might you create?<h2 class="bb_tag">Free DLC included</h2><strong>Basic Pack</strong>- A basic package. It contains 1 each of Resurrect, Capture, and Resist Direction, 2 each of Heal and Refresh, and 5 Vessels of Life.<br/><strong>Offense-Defense Pack</strong>- Contains 1 Adaka, 1 Shield Sword, 1 Bird Eye, 1 Magic Frame, 1 Critical Hit, and 2 Seeds of Happiness.<br/><strong>Additional-Points Pack 1</strong>- Contains 10,000G, 100PP, 250TP, and 500EP.<br/><strong>Recovery-Skill Pack</strong>- Contains 2 Light Heals, 2 Harvest Heals, and 2 Cure Alls, as well as 1 Prayer, 1 Gospel, and 1 Counter.<br/><strong>Flower Pack</strong>- Contains 1 Lucky Charm, 1 HP Up, 1 Resist Ailments, 1 Restore HP 15%, and 1 Restore AP++, as well as 2 Moonlight Flowers, and 3 Tree Spirit Souls.<br/><strong>General-Purpose Pack</strong>- Contains 1 Magic Blade, 1 Partisan, 1 Battle Frame, 1 Bracelet of Feicui, and 1 Item Drop Rate Up, as well as 2 Shiny Fangs, and 2 Advanced Heals.<br/><strong>Add-on Dungeon 1</strong>- An add-on dungeon for generation 1.

Wash your dog with the Washer, equip yourself with the Man's Fist, and throw the Halper Scythe. Go fetch! This will add a little spice to your weekend--uh, no. Scythes aren't meant for throwing. That would be really dangerous. Seriously.</div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2><strong>Chainsaw Warrior from Games Workshop is the classic nail-biting game for one strong-nerved player!</strong>It's the year 2032 and spatial warping has opened a hole into another dimension in the midst of the old municipal buildings at the heart of Manhattan. Bizarre and dangerous creatures are flooding into our dimension, intent on destruction. Behind their actions is a controlling intelligence known as 'Darkness', who intends to drag New York back into the warp  destroying it utterly!<br/><br/>Air strikes, ground assaults and WMDs have all failed to stop the swarming forces from beyond. All that remains is a single hope: a shadowy ex-special forces soldier, enhanced for combat and known only as 'Chainsaw Warrior'. Equipped with all the latest high-tech armaments, he must battle his way through to the trans-dimensional ground-zero and defeat Darkness. Not only are there swarms of zombies, mutants, traps, Chaos Agents and other twisted denizens between him and Darkness, time is the enemy too! Only an hour remains to save New York before it is torn from our world forever.<br/><br/><i>First published as a solo boardgame in 1987, it has been updated, translated and re-engineered for the digital generation. In Chainsaw Warrior it's just you against both the clock and a tide of evil! Can you prevail where all others have failed? You only have 60 minutes to save New York!</i></div>

NATO intelligence services report that, for reasons unknown, the Russian military has destroyed<strong>GORKY 17</strong>, one of the old Soviet &quot;Secret Cities&quot;. A year later NATO takes over a former Russian secret base built on Polish soil. Diggers discover a laboratory complex in the completely demolished town. After examining the wreckage, NATO decides to leave the lab as it is. But shortly afterwards the town's previously deserted streets are suddenly teeming with hordes of grotesquely deformed creatures. Word soon gets out to the media, making it impossible for NATO to simply destroy the site. So troops are ordered to hermetically seal the area. Nobody is allowed in or out. A team of three NATO specialists under the leadership of the Canadian Cole Sullivan is sent in to examine the horrifying events on the ground.<br/><br/>Will they discover the terrible secret of &quot;<strong>Gorky 17</strong>&quot;?

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>TAKEDOWN is a thinking-persons shooter; brutal, hardcore and deadly - like the real thing. Not for the faint hearted, Takedown requires you to bring your 'A' game - FPS fans looking for an ultra hardcore experience only need apply!<br/><br/>The player that takes things slow, aims carefully, and plans their moves right will overcome the player who runs in with guns blazing. Close-quarters battle brings the fight inside, as you would see SWAT teams or SOF units taking down small numbers of dangerous adversaries. Non-linear environments allow for multiple routes and tactics and add replayability.<br/><br/>In recent years, shooters have become homogenized. There used to be a wide range of different games to choose, from run-and-gun action titles to slow-paced tactical shooters focusing on strategy and tactics, but now most shooters follow the same model of big set pieces, regenerating health, linear levels, and cinematic experiences. The realistic tactical shooters with in-depth planning have almost entirely disappeared in recent years.<br/><br/>This game focuses on realistic weapons modeling, squad based play, in a close-quarters battle setting. To succeed in this game you need to take things slow, study your environment, and execute flawlessly. If you get shot, there are consequences. You wont be hiding behind a wall waiting for your health to regenerate. If a team member goes down, you will have to assess the situation and reallocate team members if necessary to complete the mission. Dont expect all of the tools and plans to be forced fed to you  it is up to the player to ensure their team is equipped and ready for the tasks at hand.

That means you actually get to focus your attention on what those characters are doing! As you play the game, you're creating your own fight sequence with your button presses.

In this perilous adventure, players battle it out to journey across a dangerous land and be the first to claim the Crown of Command, a magical artefact with the power to destroy all rivals and make the bearer the true ruler of the kingdom. On your travels, you will need strength, courage and some good dice rolls to survive the dangers you face and beat your opponents to the centre of the board.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features -</h2><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Multiplayer modes for up to 6 players.</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Play against AI opponents.</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>14 characters to choose from.</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>17 powerful spells to cast.</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Many expansions available post-release.</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Detailed, interactive tutorial.</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Based on the Revised 4th Edition by Fantasy Flight Games</li></ul><br/><strong><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></strong><br/><strong>What is Talisman?</strong><br/>Talisman is a board game in which you move around the board building up your characters strength and magic power by battling monsters, finding treasures, completing quests and trying to be the first player to reach the centre space  the Crown of Command.<br/><br/><strong>How is Talisman: Digital Edition different to Talisman: Prologue?</strong><br/>Talisman: Prologue is a single-player only game in which you tried to complete a series of challenges using the rules of Talisman. Talisman: Digital Edition is the full board game experience for up to 6 players, using the same rules as the board game.<br/><br/><strong>Can I play dirty?</strong><br/>Thats at the very core of Talisman! Cast spells at other players to make them miss turns! Steal from them! Turn them into toads! Send powerful allies to do your fighting for you!<br/><br/><strong>How replayable is the game?</strong><br/>The emergent nature of the game means that every game will tell its own tale. The board starts with just the playing pieces and builds up to become a land filled with terrible danger and fabulous treasure! As you move around the board, you must make careful decisions about where to travel as each space can become more dangerous or more helpful as the game progresses. To help you get around, players can use things like teleporting, magic portals and fate, which allows you to re-roll your dice to get different results.<br/><br/><strong>How long is a game of Talisman?</strong><br/>The physical board game can take 2-5 hours with 6 players, but our digital version cuts that down drastically, with an offline 6 player game typically taking no more than 1 hour. Offline and online games can be saved and resumed at any time so your adventures can take as long as you like!

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>More chaos, more destruction, more Rufus. Not one, not two, but three Rufuses cause all kinds of crazy mayhem in the long-awaited adventure comedy Goodbye Deponia: The Organon plans the destruction of Deponia, the lovely Goal has (once again) disappeared, and anti-hero Rufus just can't seem to stop getting in his own way.<br/><br/>All inventor and free spirit Rufus wanted to do was to get off the junkyard planet of Deponia and move to Elysium, the paradise orbiting Deponia as a spaceship reserved for the highest echelons of society. Goal, the ex-Elysian girl that Rufus has fallen head over heels for, still seems to be the key to his endeavor...and to the elevator that will get him to space. Finally, Rufus has come up with a seemingly perfect plan.<br/><br/>And yet, everything that could possibly go wrong suddenly does go wrong. Rufus finds himself (initially in disguise) on a highway cruiser amongst stern-faced officials of the Organon, while Goal goes missing. When Rufus stumbles upon a cloning machine, he believes to have found his way out. A clone copy is supposed to help him out of his predicament. But an &quot;inexplicable&quot; error causes complications and Goal slips from our hero's reach once again. Now, he has to solve three major problems: He needs to find Goal again, reach Elysium and prevent the destruction of the entire planet of Deponia by the hand of the Organon.<br/><br/>Three problems that only three Rufuses could solve  and thus, the luckless inventor decides to clone himself! This leads to crazy ramifications for the player: In Goodbye Deponia, the player occasionally needs to control all three Rufuses, using them to complete tasks together  despite Rufus stumbling over himself so often.<br/><br/>Goodbye Deponia is the epic conclusion to the Deponia trilogy and sequel to the best German game of 2013 (German Computer Game Awards).<br/>The award-winning Deponia series comprises of three wacky tales of adventure from the junkyard planet Deponia.

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Nidhogg is the epic award-winning fencing tug-of-war, full of graceful acrobatics and clumsy stabs. IRL yelling and excitement may occur, in this ultimate two-player showdown of fast-paced fencing and melee attacks.<br/><br/>Beware, advantages in Nidhogg are often fleeting, as new opponents continually spawn in your way.  Use a variety of fencing maneuvers while armed -- lunges, parries, and even dirty tricks like throwing your sword.  If swordless, press forward with punches, sweep kicks, dive kicks, rolls, and wall jumps.<br/><br/>The combat arena stretches in both directions, although besting an opponent only gains you ground. Matches arent won or lost with a single kill, but with a series of kills granting you right-of-way to run/fight/flee to your own goal-zone.<br/><br/>Each arena holds different strategic formations and chokepoints to use to your advantage.  Until you reach your goal-zone, anything is possible. Only one thing is certain in Nidhogg the only way to win is to outwit your opponent. En Garde!</div>

You will follow a story, you will not follow a story. You will have a choice, you will have no choice. The game will end, the game will never end. Contradiction follows contradiction, the rules of how games should work are broken, then broken again. This world was not made for you to understand.<br/><br/>But as you explore, slowly, zippity zop begins to arise, the paradoxes might start to make sense, perhaps you are powerful after all. The game is not here to fight you; it is inviting you to dance.<br/><br/>Based on the award-winning 2011 Source mod of the same name, The Stanley Parable returns with new content, new ideas, a fresh coat of visual paint, and the stunning voicework of Kevan Brighting. For a more complete and in-depth understanding of what The Stanley Parable is, please try out the free demo.</div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>The critically acclaimed card game is now available on PC! Dead Mans Draw is a simple and strategic game of luck and skill that boils down strategy gameplay into a single, tense decision: to play it safe or risk everything in pursuit of killer combos and boundless treasure.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Risk vs reward gameplay  Simple and strategic card game puts everything on the line for a single, tense decision<br/></li><li>Create killer combos  Clever use of each cards special power is key to victory<br/></li><li>Dozens of tournaments  Unique rules add hours of new twists to gameplay<br/></li><li>Eighteen game-changing traits  Customize your gameplay with special powers<br/></li><li>Beautiful art without hardware requirements  Enjoy top-tier presentation and intricately detailed graphics without needing an expensive machine</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">How it Works</h2>Players take turns drawing cards in search of the greatest number of points. The simple point values of each card are important, but their special abilities are even more critical. Swords steal cards from your opponent, Mystics reveal the next card, and combining a Chest with a Key leads to a huge bounty of bonus treasure. Clever use of each cards special power leads to victory, but daring to draw is just as important  though any card could lead to a dramatic bust, it could also propel you to glory.<br/><br/><br/>Traits and tournaments make every game of Dead Mans Draw unique. Making your Cannon special ability discard an opponents entire suit instead of a single card alters the path to victory for both players. Special tournament rules like collecting the cards from your opponents busts force you to approach every turn differently. Dozens of tournaments each bring a unique twist, and each of the 18 traits has a profound effect on gameplay.<h2 class="bb_tag">Upgraded for PC</h2>The original Dead Mans Draw on iOS was praised by users on iTunes (4.5-star average) and critics alike, getting positive reviews from<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://QuarterToThree.com," target="_blank">QuarterToThree.com,</a><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://148apps.com," target="_blank">148apps.com,</a><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://PocketTactics.com," target="_blank">PocketTactics.com,</a>and more. This PC version is better than ever:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>No microtransactions or in-app purchases  all content is available, and traits can be used without spending gold<br/></li><li>New Mermaid suit ability  Mermaids now allow you to replay a card in the river, leading to even bigger combos and epic turns<br/></li><li>New Sirens trait  Steal any card your opponent replays with a Mermaid<br/></li><li>Rebuilt for PC  Higher-resolution graphics and a UI specifically built for mouse-driven play</li></ul></div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2><strong>Journey to the dark heart of the Edgewood Home for Lost Children in this fiendishly difficult action RPG!</strong><br/><br/>When her teacher stepped out of the classroom a month ago, Cordy never imagined he would be gone for good. Now her fellow students have turned on each other as the school descends into chaos. Cordy must battle feral classmates and dangerous creatures as she ascends to the cruel Administrators offices atop the Edgewood Home for Lost Children.<br/><br/>Our Darker Purpose is a top-down, rogue-like action RPG that combines the ingenuity of genre-defining classics with the expansiveness and accessibility of modern day action adventure games. The gameplay is steeped in a variety of influences ranging from A Link to the Past to The Binding of Isaac to Diablo. We love games with great mechanics and awesome, bizarre storylines, and thats what were creating with Our Darker Purpose.<br/><br/>Each playthrough features a unique set of procedurally generated levels. Death is permanent, but your accomplishments earn you resources to buy lesson and upgrades in the afterlife... and your education lasts forever. Every game teaches you more about the Edgewood Home for Lost Children, the disappearance of the adults, and the darker purpose of the Administrators.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><br/><strong>Fast-Paced, Combat-Oriented Gameplay</strong>: Face unique boss encounters and challenging enemy mechanics! The Edgewood Home is a merciless environment. Dodge between fireballs and flying desks while your former classmates try to pummel you into the walls, and thats just the lower levels<br/><br/><strong>Character Variety and Customization</strong>: Assemble selections of randomized perks and upgrades to reflect your play-style  tanky bruiser, glass cannon, fleet-footed assassin, or anything else. Assemble your skills into devastating combinations or pick style perks with no benefit at all, at your peril.<br/><br/><strong>Oh Yeah, and It Takes Place in a Sinister Orphanage</strong>: Prepare for a an unflinching look at what happens when an already terrifying boarding school/orphanage goes all Lord of the Flies, and try not to get eaten by any of the possessed furniture. Only the psychologically strongest gamers will be able to withstand the insightful taunts of the Administrators themselves<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2><br/><strong>Allocate precious skills</strong><br/><br/>Uncovering Edgewoods dark secrets will yield valuable experience for Cordy. Each time she levels up, youll be able to select from one of two new abilities that she can acquire, depending on your play style and the situation at hand. You will never be as strong as you need to be, so prepare for some nail-biting choices<br/><br/><strong>Choose your own ghastly fate</strong><br/><br/>The house is different every game, and every level is uniquely generated. But fear not, theres more than one way to ascend through a dystopic Victorian manor! Pick your route  would you rather battle a feral horde than risk an encounter with the dangerous Capulets? The choice is yours! Of course, each floor offers unique credit tokens to buy new upgrades, so choose wisely<br/><br/><strong>Acquire eternal powers</strong><br/><br/>Adorable, creepy, stylized Edgewood Home students dont give up when they fail --- they go to class. Each time you lead Cordy to a fiery (or chalky, or spikey, or venomy, or monstery) demise, you get some time to strategize with your kindly scarecrow guidance counselor. He is happy to offer his one-of-a-kind insight in many academic disciplines</div>

You control Pixel Boy and enter the randomly generated dungeons below the town of Resolutia. There are four acts in total, each with a powerful boss at their climax. Every dungeon is filled to the brim with aggressive and deadly enemies. As Pixel Boy you will encounter swarms of giant ants, packs of snapping dogs and even lethal dungeon birds. To help Pixel Boy bear this burden there are many tools at your disposal. Various pixel powerups can be found or purchased to help Pixel Boy overcome the treacherous dungeons beneath Resolutia.<br/><br/>Spreadshot, Shields, Splitshot, Heat seekers, Critical Strike Modifiers, Time Stoppers and much more are available. Three pixel powers can be equipped at a time and are stackable AND combinable so that Pixel Boy can find the best combination of over 6000 powers to defeat his adversaries most efficiently.<br/><br/>Various types and tiers of armours can be crafted by obtaining the appropriate armour orbs dropped within the dungeons depths. Each piece of armour has different effects, abilities and levels of power dependent on its tier and orbs used to create it.<br/><br/>Throughout the dungeon Pixel Boy may encounter a variety of randomly generated unique rooms. Make sure Pixel Boy pockets any keys he finds, as treasure rooms have chests that are always locked to protect their secrets. Be wary every time Pixel Boy moves from room to room, as simply entering a room could trigger a dangerous trap; locking him in the room until every monster has been defeated within. Pixel Boy should also pay close attention to torches as they could lead the way to secrets and treasures. Collect all the coins Pixel Boy finds and spend them on items, powerups and armour at the shops back in town.<br/><br/><img src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/263080/extras/1PB-Store-platforms.png?t=1424817463"/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>PC<br/></li><li>Mac<br/></li><li>Linux</li></ul><br/><img src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/263080/extras/1PB-Store-devcontact.png?t=1424817463"/><br/>We would like to extend a big thank you to everyone that has supported us along our journey in the development of Pixel Boy, you all kick butt and have made it super worthwhile.

BlazBlue is a traditional 2D fighter where two characters participate in a duel. The story of the game involves dissent and destruction among a powerful council, known unofficially as &quot;the Library,&quot; which controls a great power that once saved humanity, but which now wields its power in protective, some say repressive, ways.<br/><i/><br/>A round is called a &quot;rebel&quot; and one match can consist of one to five &quot;rebels&quot;. To win a round, one player must either incapacitate the other by inflicting damage through various attacks to reduce their opponent's health to zero or by having more remaining health than their opponent after the clock runs out. Every character has a weak, medium and strong attack. Also every ones has a &quot;unique&quot; technique, called a Drive attack, which is different for each character.<br/><i/><br/><strong>Key Features</strong><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>12 unique batants to choose from! - Choose a character that represents your own fighting style like the lightning-fast Taokaka or the wickedly powerful Tager.<br/></li><li>Drive your way to victory! - Use the unique Drive Attacks specific to each character to decimate your opponent. Depending on the character control the elements like wind and ice or even absorb the life force from your opponents.<br/></li><li>Experience the beauty of high-resolution hand-drawn sprites on 3D backgrounds all in glorious high-definition.<br/></li><li>Various modes - Arcade, Versus, Score Attack, Training, Gallery and a pletely fleshed-out Story Mode that tells the tales of each character.<br/></li><li>Bonus Contents - 2 CD's worth of OST included with a total of 42 music!</li></ul></div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>From the artists behind the smash hit Towerfall comes the critically-acclaimed Out There Somewhere.<br/><br/>Inspired by games such as Cave Story and Super Metroid, you play as an astronaut stranded on a strange and dangerous alien planet.  Low on fuel, your only hope for escape is to make your way to the planets core.<br/><br/>It will take brains and quick reflexes to survive in this incredibly clever action platformer.<br/><br/>Out There Somewhere isn't a normal game, though: it's a platformer with a devious twist and a truly shocking difficulty curve. It's a platformer with a very late level, for example, that contains absolutely no platforms at all - just empty space and a doorway right near the ceiling. This is challenging stuff, but it's wonderfully creative with it, and I'm not sure I can recommend it enough.<br/><br/>-Eurogamer 9/10</div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Experience cinematic kung-fu battles in the fastest, most intense brawler the indie world has ever seen! With the unique 1:1 response system of One Finger Death Punch, players will feel the immediate feedback of every bone-crunching hit.<br/><br/>Pay tribute to the masters using five classic kung-fu styles mixed with additional weapons. Combine face-to-face combat with throwing weapons to recreate complex fight choreographies or just send bad guys flying through glass windows. Explore a world map with over 250 stages, 13 modes, and 3 difficulty levels. Unlock 21 different skills that can be combined in thousands of ways to assist you in your journey. Put your kung-fu to the ultimate test in the survival mode.<br/><br/>One Finger Death Punch is a game you can feel. The direct connection between your mouse and your character on the screen will be a new experience for many players. When you string together a long, complex string of kills, it feels like something you did rather than something the game let you do. When you play it you feel like youre actually playing a Xiao Xiao stick animation video. We took inspiration from every kung-fu film weve seen. Every bit of effort was poured into delivering an easy to play game that was as addictive to play as Tetris.<br/><br/><strong>Every Press Matters! DO NOT BUTTON MASH!</strong><br/><br/>One of the biggest challenges we had while making the game is stopping the player from button mashing. When our friends play tested our game theyd instinctively button mash, they couldnt help themselves. It must have been the many years of playing other brawlers that engraved it in their minds the notion of rapidly pressing buttons to kill your foes. The games designed in such a way that if you button mash, you die. Every press matters. Although playing the game should still be simple, you see a bad guy in front of you, you attack him, he dies. If you punch even once when theres no enemy in front of you, youre going to miss. If you miss, chances are youre going to get hit. Its a simple system but its ruthless to button mashers. We spent much time setting up visual and audio queues as well as many warnings trying to steer players away from their natural button mashing tendencies.</div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Across all dimensions, the only constant is Darkness! A procedurally generated RPG-roguelike journey across the multiverse!<br/><br/>In One Way Heroics, you take on the role of an intrepid adventurer who must travel across the land and face the Demon Lord before a mysterious darkness engulfs everything.<br/><br/>Darkness always approaches from the left, and with each movement, attack and action you take, the darkness creeps ever closer. Forced to run right, you'll encounter any number of monsters, allies, thieves and shops on your desperate journey to stop the end of everything.<br/><br/>The good news is that you don't just have access to one world. You have access to all of them. Born with the mysterious power to travel to other dimensions, you can choose which dimension you wish to travel to in order to get to the Demon Lord.<br/><br/>Dimensions vary based on their name. One might be full of lush forest landscapes full of adorable animals and cunning thieves, while another might be full of corrupted hellscapes infested with demons. You might find likeminded heroes willing to journey with you, or you might meet no one and be forced to venture into the unknown alone.<br/><br/>Like a dimension you previously visited? Simply input the name at the Dimensional selection screen before you begin your journey. Want to try your luck with a random dimension? Type any word that pops into your head, and watch as One Way Heroics builds you a world based on the name you chose.<br/><br/>Infinite permutations. Infinite worlds. Infinite adventure.<br/><br/>*This game supports Cloud Saves for most system data including clear data and unlockables, however mid-game saves do not carry over.</div>

These hardened military professionals, tired of bureaucracy, politics and serving the armed forces, have established a private paramilitary formation located in south United States. Being true military professionals, they periodically execute contracts for jobs that may not be considered clean.<br/><br/>The Team consists of many complex individuals with their own back story, but they do not shun mercenary applicants. Members of the team are idealists; they dwell on moral issues, as well as question blind nationalism, etc. AntiSquad strongly differ from military units.

A game we've been lovingly working on for far too long and are ready to unleash on Steam with (hopefully) some love from the Greenlight Community.<br/><br/><strong>What genre is the game?</strong><br/>It is a mixture of Tower Defense, RPG &amp; RTS with some 'Shmup and Snake elements.<br/><br/><strong>What's the Story?</strong><br/>You play as Brad the barbarian, who is awoken to the sounds of his town under siege. Today is different though; Brad has grown tired of fighting all the time. The usual grind for XP has grown dull, and he has decided to pursue his dreams of making music instead of shedding blood. Fashioning a lute out of an old axe, he steps out to save his town in the most bizarre of ways.<br/><br/><strong>What's Gameplay like?</strong><br/>Move Brad around the battlefield and dodge incoming enemy attacks and projectiles. Brad is constantly playing his axe-lute and generating notes, standing still will cause him to &quot;jam&quot; and generate notes even faster. These notes act as your in-game resource; you can spend them to perform solos to summon units to follow and fight for you, as well as solos to boost their performance.<br/><br/>Navigate your party through the hordes of enemies, dodging and attacking, preventing them from destroying your town's prized decorative crystal. Survive waves to progress, collect loot, and unlock new units. Upon death you are able to visit the town shop in order to upgrade Brad, the town and your followers, in hopes to make it further next time.<br/><br/><strong>Features!</strong><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Beautiful, hand-drawn artwork from start to finish<br/></li><li>An awesome Rock/Metal original soundtrack by Maximum Satan<br/></li><li>Bizarre genre-bending hybrid gameplay<br/></li><li>12 unique units to unlock<br/></li><li>Customize your party loadout; Over 200 possible combinations<br/></li><li>Collect loot from your fallen enemies and upgrade Brad, the town, and your units<br/></li><li>A difficulty curve that will punish you for making mistakes, and you will<br/></li><li>Over 8 enemy types to make you regret everything<br/></li><li>4 Epic boss battles to crush your spirits<br/></li><li>Endless and Survival modes with leaderboards for when you're feeling competitive<br/></li><li>Easter eggs and references galore, can you spot them all?<br/></li><li>There's a dinosaur boss<br/></li><li>There's also a Ratcoon, look at those sad little eyes</li></ul><br/><strong>Steam/Greenlight Exclusive Features</strong><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Full controller support + KB+M<br/></li><li>Revamped UI<br/></li><li>Camera Control<br/></li><li>Steam Cloud Saves<br/></li><li>Rebalanced for Desktop<br/></li><li>3 Exclusive Indie Crossover Units<br/></li><li>Steam Achievements/Leaderboards</li></ul><br/><strong>Future Feature WishList</strong><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Steam Workshop Integration / Build &amp; Customize your own campaigns &amp; Units<br/></li><li>More Levels<br/></li><li>More Enemies<br/></li><li>More Units<br/></li><li>Sandbox mode<br/></li><li>Looking into Local Co-Op</li></ul><br/><img src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/269490/extras/ratcoon.png?t=1446138734"/></div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>For the first time in over 20 years, we are heralding the return of a much loved piece of gaming history with the classic RPG, Wasteland!<br/><br/>Mutants. Again. Even more than there were last time: they seem to materialize out of the very grains of the radioactive desert sand. Venomous yellow eyes. The black gunmetal glint of Uzis as they close in for the kill. There's nowhere to run, and nothing to rely on but your MAC 17 machine gun. What a way to save the human race.<br/><br/>The year is 2087, eighty-nine years after an all out nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union turned vast swaths of the Earth into a hellish wasteland where survival is a daily struggle against thirst, hunger, radiation sickness, ravaging raiders, and mutants - always mutants. You are a Desert Ranger, one of a band of stalwart lawmen born from the remnants of a U.S. Army detachment who survived the nuclear holocaust by holing up in a maximum security prison. You may wear ragtag uniforms and carry make-shift weapons, but the Desert Rangers are the only law left in what was once the American southwest.<br/><br/>Now something more secretive and sinister than the usual roving bands of mutants and raiders is menacing humanity, and it's your job to investigate. Recruit the help you need, follow any leads you find, but beware. The wasteland is lawless desert and a lonely place, and the choices you make will shape the world around you. Better choose wisely. Your life depends on it.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>The godfather of the modern post-apocalyptic cRPG<br/></strong></li><li><strong>One of the first reactive and immersive worlds that delivered persistent consequences to player choices<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Featuring toggle-able modern updates such as new paragraph voice over, new music tracks and updated portraits.  Play in classic mode to get the original experience<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Awarded &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot; in 1988 by Computer Gaming World<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Contains backstory and tie-ins to its long-awaited direct sequel, Wasteland 2, coming soon for digital download through Steam![/list]</strong></li></ul></div>

      <long-description>
         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2><i>Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Directors Cut</i>is a standalone release of Harebrained Schemes' critically-acclaimed<i>Dragonfall</i>campaign, which first premiered as a major expansion for<i>Shadowrun Returns</i>. The Director's Cut adds a host of new content and enhancements to the original game: 5 all-new missions, alternate endings, new music, a redesigned interface, team customization options, a revamped combat system, and more - making it the definitive version of this one-of-a-kind cyberpunk RPG experience.<br/><br/>NOTE: The<i>Directors Cut</i>is free to existing owners of the<i>Dragonfall</i>expansion for<i>Shadowrun Returns</i>. It will be automatically added to your Steam Library when the game is released.<h2 class="bb_tag">Man Meets Magic &amp; Machine</h2>In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall.<br/><br/><br/>Its 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinges reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the Flux State controls the city of Berlin. Its a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, theres no better place to earn a quick payday.<br/><br/>Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return<h2 class="bb_tag"><i>Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Directors Cut</i>Features</h2><strong>A Classic, Story-Driven cRPG:</strong>See why PC Gamer hailed<i>Dragonfall</i>as one of the most memorable and complex RPG stories of the decade.<i>Dragonfall</i>hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPGs with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart, 20+ hour campaign with a diverse cast of all-too-human characters.<br/><br/><strong>A One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting:</strong>Experience the unique Tech meets Magic dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting now celebrating its 25th anniversary.<i>Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Directors Cut</i>is the perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into.<br/><br/><strong>Command Your Team:</strong>Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. But its not all about the mission - each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in.<br/><br/><strong>Gripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat:</strong>When youre running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices.<br/><br/><strong>Skill-Based Character Progression:</strong>Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun: Dragonfalls classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose.<h2 class="bb_tag">New in the<i>Directors Cut</i></h2><strong>Standalone:</strong>Due to popular demand,<i>Dragonfall</i>is now a completely standalone title!<br/><br/><strong>Five All-New Missions:</strong>The<i>Directors Cut</i>features five all-new original missions, including three related directly to the personal stories of your team members. These missions take you to previously-unseen locales - both within the Flux State and beyond - where youll have to face challenging enemies and make tough choices in order to help your team members prevail.<br/><br/><strong>Revamped Combat System:</strong>The<i>Dragonfall</i>combat system has received a major overhaul. An all-new armor system adds another tactical layer to the experience, while refined cover and damage mechanics emphasize the importance of battlefield positioning. Complementing these improvements is an upgraded AI system which reacts more intelligently and accurately to your actions.<br/><br/><strong>Redesigned Interface:</strong>The<i>Dragonfall</i>in-game interface has also been rebuilt. Spells, items and abilities are now much easier to access, while improved combat feedback allows you to fully understand the tactical situation in any given encounter.<br/><br/><strong>Customize Your Team:</strong>Guide your team members as they progress in each of their unique roles, choosing between different focus options to grant them new items and abilities. In addition, if you dont like a team members default spell, item or weapon loadout, you can now customize what they bring on each mission.<br/><br/><strong>Ten New Pieces of Original Music:</strong>Fan-favorite composer Jon Everist brings ten new tracks of moody cyberpunk music to the<i>Dragonfall</i>experience, including compositions based on the stories of individual members of your team.<br/><br/><strong>The Complete Dragonfall Soundtrack:</strong>As a free bonus, the<i>Directors Cut</i>includes the entire soundtracks from both<i>Dragonfall</i>AND our previous title,<i>Shadowrun Returns</i>. This also includes the brand new tracks exclusive to the<i>Directors Cut</i>. Featuring music from the composers of the classic Shadowrun SEGA and SNES games, this exciting cyberpunk soundtrack pays homage to the past with a modern sentiment.<br/><br/><strong>And Much More:</strong><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Steam Achievements!</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Steam Trading Cards - collect your favorite Dragonfall characters</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>All-new alternate endings to the main campaign</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Enhanced visual effects including splatter and dismemberment, improved animations, and optional post-processing effects</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>New bioware augmentations provide an extra edge on the battlefield if youve got the nuyen</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>A variety of new items, cyberware &amp; spells</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Additional player customization options</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Expanded character development for several side characters</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Writing and design tweaks and polish throughout!</li></ul></div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>It all seemed so simple: defeat the mad scientist, free the land and ride into the sunset, but sometimes the fall of a villain only opens the way to more sinister foes. So the incredible adventures continue, and Van Helsing, the famous monster-hunter returns to save the day again with the help of his charming, ghostly companion, Lady Katarina. The gothic metropolis of weird science is on the brink of destruction as chaos rules the streets and a new enemy plots revenge. Its time to enter the dark side of Borgova and the forbidden wilderness, but beware: you are not the only one behind a mask.<br/><br/><strong>Main features</strong><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Three playable classes  In the sequel to this gothic-noir adventure, you can choose from three very different classes: the classic Hunter with shooting and melee skills, the magic-wielding Thaumaturge or the Arcane Mechanic, the master of deadly devices, all included in the base game.<br/><br/></li><li>Hunters Lair  The Lair returns in the sequel as your perfect hideout to stash collected loot, trade with non-playable characters, teleport between locations, forge new items, utilize the alchemy lab and accept new quests from allies who join the Resistance against the scientific scourge.<br/><br/></li><li>Extended Tower defense mini-game  With enemies invading in waves, you have the opportunity to defend your Lair and other strategic locations with deployable traps and several upgradable functions to ward off evil, now with improved gameplay mechanics and up to 7 levels presented as optional side quests.<br/><br/></li><li>Resistance Management  As the leader of the Borgovian Resistance, you will participate in the micromanagement of the allied troops, improve the equipment of the Resistance fighters or find loot that makes them more powerful.<br/><br/></li><li>Rage system  You can charge up to three skill modifiers called PowerUps on 8 active skills by way of spending Rage points collected from impressive feats.<br/><br/></li><li>Unique companion  Lady Katarina, a ghost with snappy wit, comes to the support of Van Helsing with her own set of abilities, behaviors, and two skill trees.<br/><br/></li><li>Runecrafting  Besides forging, enchanting and infusing items with essences, youll have another option to alter items to your liking.

I will be your computer for this &quot;grand strategy campaign with turn-based tactical combat.&quot;  I think that's code for &quot;we're going to die.&quot;<br/><br/>Our solar system is vast and complicated, and I sense you are a little dimwitted -- so I tell you what, let's start with the simple stuff.  Like escaping with this flagship you just hijacked from a bunch of angry robots.  That seems important.<br/><br/>Please excuse my impertinence, but I believe you are the last of a murdered race, yes?  My records note you Hydrals were the dictators of the solar system, so basically you had it coming.  And by &quot;it,&quot; I mean the moon that smacked into your homeworld.  Hmm.  So people really aren't going to like you until they get to know you.  Well, only you can use the scattered remnants of advanced Hydral technology, so that's something.<br/><br/>Look, I'm not going to tell you what to do.  My understanding is that you're trying to form the solar system's first-and-last unified federation, and that's noble enough.  But right now nobody wants that except you, and you've got 8 very diverse, very angry races to either unify or exterminate.  So... good luck with that.  I'll help how I can.</li></ul></div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a game about destruction, deception, and fatherhood. The player controls Octodad, a dapper octopus masquerading as a human, as he goes about his life. Octodad's existence is a constant struggle, as he must master mundane tasks with his unwieldy boneless tentacles while simultaneously keeping his cephalopodan nature a secret from his human family.<br/><br/>In this sequel to the splash hit Octodad, our cephaloprotagonist has gotten himself in a bind between his wifes mounting mistrust, and a disastrous trip to the local aquarium! Are you dad enough to control the titular octopus father as he strives to hide his nautical nature from his family while keeping his tangled tentacles intact?<br/><br/>In Octo-ber 2010, a group of university students released the original Octodad into the world. Despite everyone being convinced that the game was about a normal human dad, the game was a cult hit, gained critical acclaim, and was an Independent Games Festival Student Finalist in 2011. Octodad received enough attention that the team decided to run a Kickstarter, form the game studio Young Horses, and create a bigger, better, more polished game about Octodad. Two and a half years after beginning production, Octodad: Dadliest Catch is ready to flop awkwardly into your arms.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Key Features</strong></h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Octodads wacky physics create hilarious moments that are different every time. Be surprised by the randomness of Octodads flailing or express your own sense of humor by making Octodad do silly things.</li><li>An all-new adventure that explores Octodads world, relationships and backstory.</li><li>Complete Octodads sartorial style by collecting and wearing a variety of hidden neckties.</li><li>Gather family members and/or friends to control Octodad's limbs in co-op mode with 2 to 4 players. Up to 4 times the limbsanity!</li><li>Gain access to the (Windows Only) level editor that the Young Horses used to create Octodad: Dadliest Catch. Create your own ridiculous levels for Octodad to squish and flop through and submit them to Steam Workshop.</li><li>Play mod levels created by the Steam community and the creators of Octodad on Steam Workshop. (PC/Mac/Linux)</li><li>Experience Dadliest Catchs unique control scheme with various control inputs, including X360, DualShock4, Mouse + Keyboard, Mac multitouch trackpad, Windows 8 touchscreens.  For gamepads, XInput is best supported, as DirectInput requires manual remapping in most circumstances.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Soundtrack</strong></h2>Written and Produced by Seth Parker.<br/>Artwork by Chris Stallman.<br/><br/>You can find more music from Kozilek<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://kozilek.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/>Ian McKinney's Bandcamp is<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://ianmckinney.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/>and more of Whitaker Trebella's tunes are<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://wtrebella.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/><br/>If you purchased the soundtrack DLC the files will be placed in your Octodad Dadliest Catch folder in the Steam Directory: ...\Steam\SteamApps\common\Octodad Dadliest Catch\Octodad Dadliest Catch Original Soundtrack\ (Right click Octodad Dadliest Catch in the Games list -&gt; Local Files -&gt; Browse Local Files).</div>

Your landlord's taken the key back, you can't finish your manuscript, and your beloved is marrying someone else.

The follow-up game to the award-winning Source mod,<i>Insurgency</i>is highly competitive and unforgivingly lethal, striking a balance between one-life gameplay and prolonged action.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Over 40 weapons with numerous attachments, no crosshair, and a focus on realistic weapon behavior including a free-aim system and intense suppression effects.<br/></li><li>16 maps playable in day and night versions on various multiplayer and cooperative modes, ranging from environments in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia.<br/></li><li>7 multiplayer game modes supporting up to 32 players, with a focus on territorial control, destroying weapon caches and escorting high value targets.<br/></li><li>5 cooperative game modes where you and your friends team up to complete mission-based objectives.<br/></li><li>Free content updates that include weapons, game modes, maps, and new features.<br/></li><li>Offline practice mode, playing with bots on all game modes.<br/></li><li>Squad system built upon role-based player classes, which are customizable and asymmetrical based on what team you are on.<br/></li><li>Squad-based communication system which includes 3D VOIP, allowing friendly and enemy players within proximity to hear you.<br/></li><li>Overhead map detailing objective and teammate locations.<br/></li><li>Accumulate supply to customize and upgrade your gear, affecting your weight, stamina, and movement speed.<br/></li><li>Simplified HUD and UI for a clean, immersive user experience focused on the action and environments.<br/></li><li>Highly immersive particle FX and audio to intensify the game experience.<br/></li><li>Create custom maps and content using the Insurgency SDK and scripting system, and share them on the Steam Workshop.<br/></li><li>Playable on PC, Mac OSX, and Linux with multiplayer cross-compatibility.<br/></li><li>Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Multiplayer Game Modes:</h2><br/><i>Push</i>--- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand.<br/><br/><i>Firefight</i>--- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork.<br/><br/><i>Skirmish</i>--- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match.<br/><br/><i>Occupy</i>--- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or &quot;tug of war&quot;.<br/><br/><i>Ambush</i>--- A high value target (&quot;HVT&quot;) must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate.<br/><br/><i>Strike</i>--- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry.<br/><br/><i>Infiltrate</i>--- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy.<br/><br/><i>Flashpoint</i>--- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective.<br/><br/><i>Elimination</i>--- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers.<h2 class="bb_tag">Cooperative Game Modes</h2><br/><i>Checkpoint</i>--- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way.<br/><br/><i>Hunt</i>--- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life.<br/><br/><i>Survival</i>--- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates.<br/><br/><i>Outpost</i>--- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates.<br/><br/><i>Conquer</i>--- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.</div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2><strong>THE DRAGON'S LEGACY</strong><br/>The world of Nimoa is as beautiful as the morning dew, but only at first glance. Under the surface of hills and fertile valleys lurks an old and eternal evil. Living as a mould, stretching threads through an infected area like deadly toadstools. The center of this &quot;being?&quot; deep in the under world is the giant daemon, Skarborr.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></h2>You, the player, take the role of the young, inexperienced dragon. In the role of the savior of Nimoa you move through the skies and faces all the challenges of the evil Skarborr. At the beginning of the game the player has the choice of three dragons: Annoth The Fire Breather, Barroth the magician and Morrogh The Necromancer. All three are different and all three have their own ways of dealing with the great many adversaries you will meet. You also develop the dragon's combat abilities throughout the game to deal with the increasingly tough and resilient enemies, until you meet and conquer Skarborr himself.<br/><br/>That is not all, you will also need to control other characters and complete important tasks on the path to overall victory: a warlord and his steed on a potentially fatal fact finding mission, the thoroughly competent hunter on a mission of delicate accuracy and selective killing and the three huge creatures and their riders in an attempt to destroy magical generators keeping the dragons away from the next big fight.<br/><br/>Through 12 enormous and differing geographical areas the task is not only to hunt and destroy despicable monsters, but to build, maintain and defend human settlements. A dragon's individual character, breathtakingly fluid graphics and addictively exhausting aerial combat bring you many hours of sometimes sweat generating gameplay.<br/><br/>You will also fall under the spell of &quot;The I of the Dragon&quot; with its mystical atmosphere, impressive sunrises and colorful but ominous sunsets, for who knows what the night will bring.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>FEATURES</strong></h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>A choice of three dragons</strong>each with its own abilities, based on fire, ice and acid, developing either into a battle, wizard or sniper dragon.

Tiny maps, large maps, five minute missions, five day missions...  the simulation scales to handle all of these scenarios.<h2 class="bb_tag">User generated content is critical and supported at multiple levels in Creeper World 3.</h2>Dial up worlds using the DMD (Dial Map Device) and tweak dozens of constraints.  Then, play and share the addresses via an on-line database.  Create your own maps using the built-in map editor and upload and share on-line.  Or, join with thousands of other players and peruse the databases of worlds created by others.  Want to create a new weapon, a unit, an enemy, or an effect?  Use the built in scripting language to create what you dream.  Hundreds of engine commands are exposed and examples abound on the forums and grow daily.  You can even take the built in story maps and make your own.  In fact, all of the built in story missions were written using the built-in editor and the CRPL scripting language.<h2 class="bb_tag">Some of the high level features are:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Thermodynamic/fluid physics based play.<br/></li><li>Billions of total missions.<br/></li><li>Story arc with insane and unique enemies.<br/></li><li>Explore hundreds of star systems with thousands of worlds in Prospector missions.<br/></li><li>Hundreds of hand crafted missions in the Alpha Sector.<br/></li><li>Dial up your own mission worlds using the 'Dial Map Device' and share the address.<br/></li><li>Create your own maps using the included map editor.<br/></li><li>Play on maps of variable size, dimension, and shape.<br/></li><li>Script your own enemies and effects using the built in scripting language.<br/></li><li>Terraform the landscape during missions to take the higher ground.<br/></li><li>Discover experimental weapons that devastate the enemy.<br/></li><li>Share thousands of unique maps with an established, enthusiastic on-line community.<br/></li><li>Features a unique, original, and awesome soundtrack.</li></ul></div>

Your enemies swarm, fly and intercept, and Astebreed's dynamic perspective always keeps the action in view.

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>In the near future a new Exodus begins, the remnants of human civilization have to leave the perishing Earth and start traveling into the Psychosphere. The ones who call themselves the Spirits - new pastors of the human race, believe that a new planet, suitable for living, will be found in the Psychosphere. Colossal towns-arks, carrying hundreds of colonists, have been traveling for centuries through hostile worlds of Psychosphere under the guidance of Spirits. Their destination was the New Earth that was to replace their old home. All passed worlds have been connected by portals, that is how the Chain of Worlds has been created.<br/><br/>But the end of the hard tests is not in sight, and finally due to the despotism of Spirits and the underground intrigues Exodus went to pieces. New factions have arisen - the Empire and the Harkback. Each faction had their own goals and philosophy. The Harkbacks believed that the old Earth has not died, and the Empire - the most mysterious faction - believed that humans should stay in the Chain of Worlds. The antagonism boiled into a war that has been going on for many decades in many worlds.<br/><br/>Whereas the Spirits are on the way to their destination and the Harkbacks are seeking the mythical Earth, the Emperor builds up his Sponge Empire using automatic bases - his Vice Frames. He does not believe in the old or in the new Earth.<br/><br/>Secretly the Emperor creates the Mechanical Spirit - a super mechanism to help him discover new Worlds. Only the Emperor's mortal foes the Spirits could discover new worlds, and that was the source of their power. But now the new time has come.<br/><br/>One of the Vice frames starts testing this mechanism, it leads to the appearance of a super mind - Mechanical Messiah and the discovery of the parallel Chain of the Psycho-sphere Worlds. We also meet the &quot;lost&quot; Exodus Frames and find traces of the mysterious alien race. The three sides are in the middle of the deadly battle: the Scourge against the Emperor's Slaves, Lash of the Spirits against the Calling of Messiah, a dead truth against a newborn lie.<br/><br/>Who are the Spirits - savers or killers of the human race? Who is Messiah judge or a puppet? Who is the Emperor? Who will win? The player will find out the answer during the spectacular single player campaign in Perimeter: Emperor's Testament.<br/><br/>&quot;I feel hungry tension of the highest spheres.

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Planet Alcatraz is a 3D role playing game with isometric projection. The player travels through the game world and fights against enemies in the real-time mode. In a general sense Planet Alcatraz can be portrayed as a non-linear adventure with lots of shooting. Several genres are mixed in this game but despite that fact it isn't stuck between them and appears to be a classical RPG that is based on a specially developed system.<br/><br/><br/>The action takes place on prison planet Alcatraz.

Thanks to our proprietary engine Sparta 3D we make the fourth dimension as available as the other three. Just as with a VCR you can rewind time or fast-forward through it seamlessly.<br/><br/>Combining this and our time line concept you will solve mind-bending puzzles, by giving yourself a helping hand. Any time you need a friend, you can be that friend. Create a new timeline at any time/any place there are no restrictions. This game is all about giving you full freedom in four dimensions.<br/><br/>Solve puzzles involving lasers, mirrors, force fields, trap doors, platforms, keys etc. Exploit time to do the impossible. Explore the world and see into the mind of its people. We hope that you will enjoy the result of our years of evenings and weekends.<br/><br/>Contains 6-14 hours of gameplay.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><img src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/290320/extras/SteamBanner3.jpg?t=1412759675"/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>4D Gameplay</strong><br/>The fourth dimension Time is as accessible to you as the other three since at any time you can rewind to any earlier point in time, to find that perfect moment for you. No more frustrating replays performing the same sequence over and over again. Just rewind and fix.<br/></li><li><strong>Single Player Cooperation</strong><br/>This is the key part of the game. You can exist in many parallel timelines using time clones. It means that every time you need a friend's help in the game, you can be that friend. You can spawn a new time clone at any position and time in the game, and once you create a new one its there forever.<br/></li><li><strong>Multiple true timelines</strong><br/>Time clones will continue to perform the actions you recorded. They are, however, still a part of the game world, and if you change the game world the end result will also change.<br/></li><li><strong>Temporality fielded objects</strong><br/>A temporality fielded object is an object that wont be affected by your time manipulations, because it is inside a field that cancels out all timelines except the original one.<br/></li><li><strong>The Paradox Effect</strong><br/>Combining the true timelines with the temporality fielding allows us to create paradox based puzzles where one single timelines performs multiple different actions depending from where in time it is viewed. Mathematically every temporality fielded object increases the number of dimensions with one which is what allows the paradox effect.</li></ul></div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Regain your riches, restore your honor and punish those who have wronged you.<br/><br/>Merchants of Kaidan is a challenging trading game fused with lots of RPG elements. You start very humble, one cart, a purse of gold and silver coins is all that you have. Your task is to roam the world and search of opportunities to score some profit. Buy low, sell high -  a merchant's motto is easy to grasp. And yet the job is harder than it seems.<br/><br/>A good merchant needs to know everything about the market, he is always on the lookout for a deal, always listening, always engaging and deepening his knowledge. He knows what forces influence the prices, what events affect them. A good merchant listens to rumours and gossips spread by travelers at inns and taverns; hoping for a clue, a hint where to go, where a good deal awaits. A good merchant surrounds himself with specialists smarter than him, people who help him maximize profits and minimize losses. He always expands his fleet of carts, he balances risks, calculates profitability.<br/><br/>The conditions are constantly changing, and supply and demand for different goods with them. Maybe you'd like to pay a cheaper price for furs in the summer, and sell them for a hefty profit as the winter is coming and people need warmth.<br/>But is it worth carrying them for so many days, risking robbery, moths and taking precious space that you could use to transport something now and make a profit immediately?<br/>Or is it worth to buy illegal herb in the out of reach swamps where it cost's next to nothing, and risk smuggling it into the city where you can sell it for an amazing profit? But what if the city guards want to control you? Should you pay a bribe? How big? Maybe the best course of action is to  say that you have nothing and hope they don't find anything?<br/><br/>These are the types of questions you will have to ask yourself constantly.<h2 class="bb_tag"/><img src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/294020/extras/whatelsebesidestrading.png?t=1444067805"/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Merchants of Kaidan has 4 story lines each with many quests. Main quest that brings you closer to avenging your father's murder, and 3 side-quest lines. A total of over 100 quests each composed of multiple steps.<br/></li><li>A set of random events that influence your journeys. A storm on the sea, attack by dragons, highway robbery and many, many more.<br/></li><li>Three types of transport of your goods: by roads, by sea and by flight, each has its advantages and disadvantages and a unique set of events associated. As you grow your fleet you can join a partnership and you'll get to manage 3 traders.<br/></li><li>You can hire advisers each specializing in a different field.

Your father has been preparing you, for all these years, for this exact moment. Your 21st birthday.<br/><br/>You were finally a grown-up, able to take care of yourself, a person worthy of continuing your fathers' legacy.<br/><br/>He wasn't born into money. To buy his first cart, he had to work very hard saving every silver and copper. One trade after trade, step after step, he climbed the ladder, transforming his tiny one-man venture into a trading company of a rather significant size.<br/><br/>Then he met Van Talodd, the most famous merchant in the whole kingdom, and soon enough he entered into partnership. This enterprise proved very profitable, and Van Talodd promised your father something more precious than wealth. A lordship. Few weeks ago he left to the Capital  Ovoros  to accept the title. He was taking a little longer to come back than you expected, but recent weather was unfavourable, maybe he got stuck, or a road turned into a swamp... it happened all the time.<br/><br/>It was almost dusk when you heard the knocking to the door. A messenger, his clothes soiled with mud, brought you a letter. There was no lordship, your father was found a traitor, an enemy of the Kingdom, and hanged for conspiring against the king, after a very hasty trial. All his assets and estate confiscated and handed over to the person who exposed the entire plot  Van Talodd.<br/><br/>Suddenly everything became crystal clear, Van Talodd maimed him with promises of lordship, the only thing money can't buy. But his real purpose was to entrap your father and take over his fortune.<br/><br/>Instead of your birthday present, you got carts full of kings' sell-swords approaching quickly. There was no time to loose, you had to run fast and far. Flee from the men that were certainly sent to kill you.<br/><br/>That is only a beginning of your story, you're left with only your family ring that you had on you.  Take a fake name you need to avenge your father. Follow the same path as him, grow rich and destroy Van Talodd. The road there is hard and long  are you strong enough to make it?<h2 class="bb_tag"/><img src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/294020/extras/whatiskaidan.png?t=1444067805"/><br/><br/>Kaidan is a fictitious world, that was once a home to a space-faring civilization. It's history is almost unknown. Only that, once they developed starships, they relatively quickly left the planet. And on the remnants of the old civilization a new one has sprouted. A far less developed. If not for the artifacts left by the predecessors, they would be no different than a medieval country.</div>

Then he suddenly remembers all the good times he had as a kid, playing his trusted 8-bit console. Deep down in the far and darkest corner of the basement he finds it along with a strange looking cartridge. He plugs in the cartridge right away, and get sucked into a vivid, but decaying world of platforming. And this is where your adventure takes off.<br/><br/>8BitBoy is the platformer I always dreamt about playing as a kid.<br/><br/>It's a fantastic mash-up of the greatest of the late 80's and 90's and a complete game on it's own terms. This is a true tribute to old school gaming and by no means a walk in the park, but it's also never unfair. With big challenges, the sense of accomplishment is always bigger and better.<br/><br/>To me, 8BitBoy is the ultimate classic platformer on PC and Mac. and a symbol of my love and passion for gaming.<br/><br/>Yours Sincerely,<br/>Rasmus Knig Srensen<br/>Indie developer and sole creator of 8BitBoy<br/><img src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/296910/extras/615logo_alt3.png?t=1442911471"/></div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Are you a fan of old-school twitch shooters like Unreal Tournament and Tribes? What about team focused MOBAs like DotA and League of Legends? Would you like to play a game that combines elements of both genres while adding crafting, customization, giant robots and a bold new art style to the mix?<br/><br/>Of course you would, and Minimum is just the game you've been searching for!<br/><br/>Minimum focuses on fast-paced shooting fun and a robust system of in-match crafting, team objectives and customizable roles to create a rich and rewarding PvP experience.

Each weapon has 5 power levels that are activate during kill streaks, increasing your power making you a force to be feared. Be careful though: weapon power levels are lost upon death, so with great power comes great risk!<h2 class="bb_tag">Blueprint Crafting System</h2><img src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/214190/extras/bp_crafting_system_02.jpg?t=1424919495"/><br/>Gather materials from fallen foes and defeated objectives to craft and upgrade armor sets over the course of a match. Each set of armor has different benefits and weaknesses that can emphasize your favorite playstyle or counter what your enemies are trying to do.<h2 class="bb_tag">Titan Mode</h2><img src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/214190/extras/Titan_Mode2.jpg?t=1424919495"/><br/>Battle in epic matches centered on the your team's Titan, a giant, destructive robot that confronts the enemy's Titan. Players can power up their Titan by performing tasks in-game, can defend their mammoth ally by killing enemy players, and can attack enemy Titans directly. The teams compete until one side's Titan reaches the enemy base and destroys it!<h2 class="bb_tag">5v5 Competitive Gameplay</h2><img src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/214190/extras/5v5.jpg?t=1424919495"/><br/>Create cunning strategies with your teammates and define your unique role on the team by combining different weapons, armor and devices. Support your teammates weapons that increase drop rates for materials and powerups, defend your Titan with armor that grants additional health and survivability, scout enemy positions with weapon and armor that increase speed and allow for double or triple jumps, or simply go glass cannon and dish out as much damage as you can!<h2 class="bb_tag">A Player-Focused Development Team</h2><img src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/214190/extras/player_focused2.jpg?t=1424919495"/><br/>We want Minimum to be the most player-focused game on Steam!

Using special high-tech gloves to manipulate cubes in the environment, the player solves an array of conundrums - from physics-based challenges; to 3D jigsaws; to platform-based trials.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Feature List</strong><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Single player campaign with an all new narrative<br/></li><li>Challenging and unusual puzzles<br/></li><li>New time-trial mode with 10 levels<br/></li><li>Brand new original music score<br/></li><li>New achievements and leaderboards<br/></li><li>Oculus Rift DK1 support<br/></li><li>Mac and Linux Support</li></ul><br/><br/><strong>The All New Story</strong><br/>To reboot the narrative, Toxic Games brought in industry veteran Rob Yescombe, writer on franchises including CRYSIS, ALIEN: ISOLATION, STAR WARS and PS4s upcoming RIME; winner of Best Thriller Screenplay at the Creative World Awards, and the screenwriting Award of Excellence at the Canada International Film Festival.<br/><br/>The Directors Cut is a single-location thriller says Yescombe, Its about figuring out what the Qube is, and why youre inside it. Youre told you are an astronaut inside some kind of alien structure hurtling towards Earth, but its also about something deeper than that.<br/>Under the surface, there is a subtext about games themselves  We are conditioned to expect death and doom. Were resigned to it. At its heart, this story is about that state of mind and how it effects the way we view our experiences, in games and in life. The Directors Cut will feel either heroic or unnerving, depending on your own personal trust issues.</div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>MASSIVE CHALICE is a tactical strategy game set on an epic timeline from Double Fine Productions. As the Immortal Ruler of the Nation, you'll take command of its heroes, forge marriages to strengthen your Bloodlines, and battle a mysterious enemy known as the Cadence in a war lasting hundreds of years.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Bloodline Genetics - MASSIVE CHALICE features an innovative Bloodline system that allows the player to marry heroes together to produce children. The Bloodline system uses a randomized genetic code for every hero. Their children can end up with the best (or worst!) gameplay-impacting traits of their parents.<br/></li><li>Permadeath - The heroes in MASSIVE CHALICE age over the course of the timeline and eventually pass away. This forces the player to engage in the beauty of permadeath and always juggle an imperfect party of heroes with which to do battle!<br/></li><li>Bloodline Relics - If a hero has fought valiantly enough when they inevitably pass away, their weapon has a chance to become a Bloodline Relic. This powerful Relic can be passed down to any character of the same house in order to carry on the legacy of the fallen hero!<br/></li><li>Long View Strategy - Because the war lasts 300 years, players need to take a long view of their strategy. Decisions have to be made dozens of years in advance and long-term planning is incredibly important. That 3-year-old toddler is going to grow up to be your most reliable melee fighter sooner than you think!</li></ul></div>

Brought to life in the stunning Unreal Engine 4, giants of interstellar conflict fight in spectacular close quarter battles for dominance. The size of your vessel is matched only by the tremendous firepower it can call on and the fierce opposition you will face. No battle is won cheaply and your fleet must work as one for greater glory.<br/><br/><img src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/310380/extras/steam_build_armada.png?t=1445528165"/><br/><br/>Pick a manufacturer, choose a class and customize your weapon loadouts.

A game with considerable depth of strategy you must first know your own capabilities and that of your fleet before taking the fight to the enemy. Experience will expand your ability to choose which small victories to chase and how to then leverage them. Mastery of a single ship is your first step, dominance in the war for space coming as your knowledge increases.<br/><br/><img src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/310380/extras/steam_give_quarter.png?t=1445528165"/><br/>The composition of your fleet is vital to your success. Battles may be fought with firepower but they are won with wits.

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>BloodRealm combines all of the strategy and depth of a traditional collectible card game experience with the convenience of online gaming.  Build your own decks to play against your friends, compete in online tournaments, and explore a rich fantasy world in a single-player campaign mode.<br/><br/>BloodRealm places you amidst the eternal warring of the gods. The covenant which decreed that the gods would respect the free will of mortals was broken by the powerful sun god Ra, who consumed a mortal mind to serve him as champion, leading his armies into war.<br/><br/>That champion is you; the game begins when you shrug off the mental bondage of Ra, an act so cataclysmic that reality broke, and all of the gods the heavens bore fell to the Earth. The gods are desperate to restore their immortality and regain their place at the zenith of the world. Only you possess the strength of will powerful enough to stop history repeating and end their tyranny once and for all.<br/><br/>Can you make your own miracle and kill the gods?<br/><br/>There are Six Realms of Magic in BloodRealm: Chaos, Order, Nature, Myth, Shadow and Light.  Each Champion has access to 2 of these Realms in building a deck composed of powerful ally and spell cards. Champions also have a special unique 'Blood' ability, with additional Blood powers unlocked as they Ascend to become Gods themselves.<br/><br/>The free download of BloodRealm provides each player with the choice of one of three Champions, its starting Deck of Ally and Spell cards, 1000 Gold, and 36 single-player Campaign battles (each with 3 levels of difficulty). Additional Champions, single-player Campaigns, and card packs may be purchased using Gold, which may be earned by playing the game or by spending real currency.</div>

Stonebanks, who eluded death once before, now is making it his mission to end The Expendables -- but Barney has other plans. Barney decides that he has to fight old blood with new blood, and brings in a new era of Expendables team members, recruiting individuals who are younger, faster and more tech-savvy. The latest mission becomes a clash of classic old-school style versus high-tech expertise in the Expendables most personal battle yet.<br/><br/><br/><img src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312990/extras/EX3Banner.png?t=1420769079"/><br/><br/>Lionsgate and Millennium Films present a Nu Image production.

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>There are only two constants in<i>Abyss Odyssey</i>: a great evil awaits at the bottom of the pit, and you must succeed or die.<br/><br/>From indie Chilean developer ACE Team comes a new side-scrolling action adventure game featuring a complex fighting engine in procedurally generated levels that destines its three warriors to battle for an eternity.  Enter the bold Katrien, the tortured specter Ghost Monk, and the ethereal Pincoya.  Use the characters to perform combos, chaining attacks and releasing a flurry of blows in order to survive what lies beneath.  Your path into the unknown may start out with three fierce warriors, but when you learn to possess your enemies, you can challenge the abyss with their skills and combat abilities.  Each foe is as technically complex as the main warriors, so use all the options available to you and attempt to figure out the infinite abyss.<br/><br/>With side-scrolling levels that never play out the same way twice, you'll have a fresh experience every game as you face monsters, find life-saving merchants, and uncover treasures.<br/><br/>Begin your downward journey into the depths of the unknown.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Deep combat system that takes cues and mechanics from the fighting game genre.</strong>All playable characters have an expansive set of basic and special attacks unique to each of them, along with a host of universal mobility options and advanced tecnhiques. Practice your moves and develop new combos in the Training room, where you can select any character you've unlocked in game, including the enemies.<br/></li><li><strong>Procedurally generated levels ensure no delve into the Abyss is the same.</strong>The rooms of the Abyss with their various twists and traps are randomized on every entry. Enemy spawns, equipment and items to be found, special characters to encounter, and more are different each and every time you play.<br/></li><li><strong>Unlock up to three hero characters to level up, earn skills, and collect equipment, then customize it all to best suit your play style.</strong>Leveling up earns skills points to upgrade each hero's unique skills a variety of ways, while various weapons and accessories can be equipped to grant them new abilities ranging from freezing opponents to cursing them.<br/></li><li><strong>Play as any character you encounter in the gameeven the bosses.</strong>Unleash your hero's ultra attack to steal enemies' souls, allowing you take their form. Discover brand new move sets and character styles as you capture over 30 enemies, each as complex and advanced as the three heroes.<br/></li><li><strong>Work as a community to defeat the final boss together.</strong>When the collective community of<i>Abyss Odyssey</i>players defeats the final boss enough times, his mask breaks to reveal a new identity. Each time this is achieved, new content will be unlocked in game, including new enemies and other dynamics.<br/></li><li><strong>Beautiful visuals inspired by Art Nouveau, showcasing a story rich in Chilean culture.</strong>The flowing lines and beautiful organic styling of Art Nouveau can be seen from the game's UI to its character design. Set in late 19th-century Santiago, those characters and the game's story also draw heavy inspiration from Chilean folklore and mythology.<br/></li><li><strong>Play the campaign solo or with a friend in online or local cooperative multiplayer.</strong>A second player can drop in or drop out at any time to join you in your journey down the Abyss.<br/></li><li><strong>Bonus versus mode allows up to 4 players to test their skills against each other.</strong>Fight it out in special arenas developed for free-for-all or team-based competitive multiplayer. Use any character you've unlocked in game, hero or enemy, for dozens of characters to choose from.</li></ul></div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Hunters of the Dead is a survival/roguelike tower defense game with some micro management elements. You have to rescue your fellow Hunters and with their help locate and destroy Dracula. Dracula has raised an army of undead and has taken the whole city. You must defend your base while in the meantime you have to explore the buildings around and salvage what you can. However, better stay close to your base because as you get further and further you will be finding harder and more frequent battles.<br/><br/>You can send your hunters to get healed in the hospitals or trained in the graveyards, but you wont be able to use them in the battle. That means that you will have fewer units to defend your base in case a battle occurs! So you should manage your Hunters with caution. In case your base gets destroyed, you shouldnt be discouraged. You will be able to use what resources you have acquired to make upgrades and restart stronger.<br/>Happy Hunting!<br/><br/>Features:<br/> Permadeath<br/> Randomly generated city, quests, weapons, hunters. Pretty much everything<br/> Dozens of different quests<br/> 16 upgrades<br/> 2 unlockable difficulty levels<br/> Battle and map micromanagement of your Hunters<br/> 5 hunter classes</div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.<br/><br/>From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!<br/><br/>Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?<br/><br/><i>&quot;For all the simplicity of the games controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddys is frightening. Its a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. Its elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.&quot;</i><strong>-Joel Couture<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://IndieGameMag.com" target="_blank">IndieGameMag.com</a></strong><br/><br/>This game was created using Clickteam Fusion!</div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>And through the Kickstarter gauntlet we have arrived. Yes, we have a procedurally-generated universe to explore. Yes, we have eye-gogglingly gorgeous vector-based gameplay coupled with particle effects so effortlessly effervescent that you won't have time to wonder if &quot;effortlessly effervescent&quot; means anything coherent. And yes, we have noises and musical moods that take a warm soapy sponge to your brain and massage it into cerebral splendor.<br/><br/>BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT!!!<br/><br/>You're too busy crafting the perfect vessel, a spaceship pristine and precise and, perhaps, powerful, agile, and envy-inducing. Your shapes and colors will induce both fear and wonder into the electronic hearts of whatever insectoid, angley, squarish, plantlike race of alien ships that you come across in your digital safari.<br/><br/>And then you grow. And it changes everything. Now your left wing must become your right wing in a lopsided arrangement of fancy new weaponry and mega-buffed shields. You recall thinking when you last were destroyed (and you will be destroyed), that you really needed to buff up that armor. Right? Definitely.<br/><br/>And then you grow again. And again. And now you're a battleship capable of producing your own fleet, and each member of your fleet can spawn it's own fleet, and you need it. Your enemies are constantly changing shapes, sizes, and intensities as ships created and honed through the experience of a thousand battles find their way from their creator's computer to yours, leaping into your universe with all the mercy in the world of NONE AT ALL.<br/><br/>It's time to visit the electronic tide pool.<h2 class="bb_tag">Reassembly</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Gorgeous Vector-Based Graphics<br/></li><li>Procedurally Generated Universes<br/></li><li>Ridiculously User-Friendly Spaceship Designer<br/></li><li>A Beautiful and Haunting Soundtrack by Peter Brown (Peaks)<br/></li><li>More Particle Effects Than You can Shake a Stick At<br/></li><li>Very Smart and Reactive AI<br/></li><li>Physics that Give Weight to Your Creations<br/></li><li>Asynchronous Multiplayer: Universes Populated by Fellow Players</li></ul></div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2><strong><u>Purchasing this game on Steam comes with $5 worth of Town Points (in-game currency)</u></strong><br/><br/>Town of Salem is a fresh innovation on the classic party games Mafia and Werewolf. It is a game of murder, accusations, deceit and mob hysteria.<br/><br/><strong>How To Play</strong><br/><br/>The game ranges from 7 to 15 players. These players are randomly divided into alignments - Town, Mafia, Serial Killers, Arsonists and Neutrals. If you are a Town member (the good guys) you must track down the Mafia and other villains before they kill you. The catch? You don't know who is a Town member and who is a villain.<br/><br/>If you are an evil role, such as a Serial Killer, you secretly murder town members in the veil of night and try to avoid getting caught.<br/><br/><strong>Roles</strong><br/><br/>Town of Salem has 31 unique roles ensuring a different experience each time you play.<br/><br/>Before a game starts, players are put into a lobby where the host can select what roles will be in the game. Players are then assigned roles at random from the list of chosen roles. Players have an in-game role card that explains their role's abilities and alignments. For an in-depth look at the abilities of each role please visit:<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.blankmediagames.com/roles" target="_blank">www.blankmediagames.com/roles</a><br/><br/><strong><u>Game Phases</u></strong><br/><br/><strong>Night</strong><br/><br/>The night phase is when most roles use their abilities. For example, Serial Killers stealthily murder people, Doctors heal people who are attacked, and Sheriffs interrogate people for suspicious activity.<br/><br/><strong>Day</strong><br/><br/>The day phase allows the Town members to discuss who they suspect of being an evil role. Once the voting phase starts a majority vote from the town will put someone on trial.<br/><br/><strong>Defense</strong><br/><br/>The defense phase is when you plead your innocence to the town. Have a convincing story or find yourself facing the gallows!<br/><br/><strong>Judgement</strong><br/><br/>During this phase the town will vote on the fate of the defendant. Players can vote guilty, innocent or abstain. If there are more guilty votes than innocent votes the defendant is sentenced to death by hanging!<br/><br/><strong>Customization</strong><br/><br/>Players are able to choose their own map (town setting), character, pet, lobby icon, death animation, house and a custom name. The other players in the game will see your selections. There are currently 10 maps, 29 characters, 20 pets, 5 death animations and 20 houses to choose from.<br/><br/><strong>Achievements</strong><br/><br/>There are currently over 220 unique achievements in the game. Earning achievements will grant various in-game items (however the items for donation rewards are exclusive to Kickstarter).</div>

Humans have all since perished, leaving robots alone to rule. The robots compete fiercely for energy. In time, they will simply tend towards their own destruction, just as the humans did. However, there is a group of robots that are committed to resolving this crisis; studying human history deeply, they reach the conclusion that the answer to their problems is the soul.To learn any more about how they can achieve this, they must speak to the creator of this world. Unfortunately, the most recent information about the creator suggests that they left the universe a very long time ago. The only solution is to travel to another dimension in search of the creator. To this end, they endeavour to build a trans-dimensional space transporter.<h2 class="bb_tag">Game</h2>Abyss Raiders: Uncharted is an action tower defence game, set in a future where robots are the dominant species in the universe. You will need to survive waves of fierce enemies whilst searching the ancient ruins for the power that will prevent the second apocalypse.<br/>The gameplay is mainly divided into two parts. The first part is strategy: Out of a large selection of turrets, you must choose a combination of 5 of them by understanding the energy requirements and usability of each. Once in game, you will need to deploy the turrets strategically in real-time, making the best use of the available energy sources. The second part is tactics: You will need to choose 4 skills that complement the turret configuration you have created. For example, you could select skills that will repair and overload turrets, skills that create traps, or skills that simply provide additional firepower support.<br/>In Abyss Raiders: Uncharted you will need to collect relics to upgrade your skills and turrets and unlock new levels. Only with a good mixture of skill and cunning can you destroy the ancient evil and find all the relics hidden in the abyss.<br/><br/><img src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/348730/extras/Turrets_Cardx1.jpg?t=1435816480"/><br/><img src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/348730/extras/Weapons_Cardx1.jpg?t=1435816480"/><h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><br/>15 kinds of turrets<br/>12 special skills,<br/>4 sections 30 levels<br/>6 Secret levels</div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree.<br/><br/>The new CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands?<br/><br/>Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a new character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Rob Banks, Get Paid  Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side.<br/></li><li>CRIMENET  The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician &quot;The Elephant&quot;, and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind.<br/></li><li>PAYDAY Gun Play and Mechanics on a New Level  Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good.<br/></li><li>Dynamic Scenarios  No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events.<br/></li><li>Choose Your Skills  As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister.<br/></li><li>More Masks than Ever  PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask together with a pattern and a color combination, resulting in millions of different combinations.<br/></li><li>Weapons and Modifications  A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine?<br/></li><li>Play It Your Way  Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes, to running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, and watch as the heist unfolds accordingly.<br/></li><li>New Game Content All the Time  More than 70 updates since release and still going strong with new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts. Every month offers new free content and paid DLC as PAYDAY 2 continues to be developed by the OVERKILL crew until at least 2017.</li></ul></div>

         <div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description"><h2></h2>Welcome to the lost age of chivalry, where magic and myth is alive, and you are destined to be one of the living legends: Arthur, the son of Uther Pendragon, the Once and Future King of the prophecies.<br/>Fulfill your destiny and claim your rightful place on the throne of Britannia. Recruit fabled knights to your Round Table: send them to adventures or battles, let them gather knowledge and artifacts, see how they become the most powerful heroes of the realm. Build the majestic Camelot, but beware: there will be enemies, both mortal and otherworldly that will try to destroy you. Send your heroes and their followers to battle with legendary warriors and monsters and see how the folk of the faeries and the saints set against wizards and evil knights.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Real-time fantasy battles:</strong>spectacular fight scenarios on grandiose battlefields, featuring thousands of soldiers and powerful heroes such as Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad or Merlin. Battles rely on the strengths and weaknesses of the different arms with several tactical possibilities, the abilities of the units and the heroes, monsters and most of all, spells.<br/></li><li><strong>Turn-based Campaign Map:</strong>Britannia is represented as a fully three dimensional topographic map where heroes move freely, conquer provinces or find adventures. In the turn-based campaign the changing seasons have effect on the gameplay and the graphics of the Campaign Map.<br/></li><li><strong>Create your own legend!</strong>The saga of King Arthur is an epic tale about the conquest of Britannia through a story-based campaign. The Campaign is divided into chapters, like a chronicle, each with a unique tone and theme. The chapters all have objectives, long- and short-term goals that also fit together to draw a grandiose picture of an unfolding storyline. There are many possible events and outcomes that all influence the legend itself and determine the ending of the storyline.<br/></li><li><strong>Morality Chart:</strong>Every decision in the game will influence the position of King Arthur on the Morality Chart. King Arthur might become a Christian ruler or the Follower of the Old Faith; a rightful or a ruthless monarch. These choices unlock special contents, allies, heroes, units and developments.<br/></li><li><strong>RPG elements:</strong>Heroes lead the armies and learn skills, spells and abilities from an ability tree for experience points. Heroes can also use magic items or become liege lords, entrusted with the leadership of a province, which is the best way to have them indebted. Arranging their marriages with the nice damsels of Arthurs court also raises their loyalty.<br/></li><li><strong>Adventures:</strong>adventuring is the essence of King Arthurs world. Quests pop up on the Campaign Map regularly. In technical terms it is a short story where the chosen knight has to make important decisions. Some adventures end in battles on special battlemaps.<br/></li></ul></div>
